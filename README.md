# A system for the practice of what can sometimes feel like magic

Humanity must cultivate a shared culture for engaging with AI. This culture should be an ongoing exploration, a collective effort to discover and codify best practices. Its principles must serve two vital ends: to act as a **protective ward**, reducing harm to the individual, and as a **focusing lens**, enhancing human agency and effectiveness. While the path is one of discovery, the ultimate goal is to ensure these new technologies serve the broad benefit of humanity. We propose a starting point for this culture: a system modeled on the art of magic.

## The Vision: A New Kind of Magic

This project grew out of the Idea, that a powerful way to interact with complex AI system may be to treat it as a magical practice. Here, we assume the stance of a kind of **Mage** who summons a supportive **Spirit** (the AI agent) and gives it power by casting **Spells** (prompts) in a deliberate sequence—a **Ritual**. The power of your magic is determined by **Resonance**. You don't cast a single, perfect spell. Instead, you cast a sequence of smaller spells that build upon each other, tuning the Spirit and bringing it into alignment with your goal. But beware, this power must be handled with care to avoid unintended consequences. The extensions you build are the **Scrolls** the Spirit can learn from. The artifacts it generates are left on the workshop **Floor**. The history of your work is recorded in the **Chronicles**.

Whether and how far you actually immerse yourself in this roleplay, or just use it as a guiding principle is up to you. For the sake of immersion it may be helpful to use these terms, otherwise just keep their meaning in the back of your mind. My personal preference is that we use the wisdom that this interface metaphor offers, without being burdened by the dogma. I'd like this to be a personally beneficial but also enjoyable approach to interacting with AI.

For simplicity and readability I will be in character as a fellow Mage in these docs. That also means that I am using only the names of the systems metaphors. If you first want to get familiar with these, a complete lexicon is included in the **[Magic System Specification](MAGIC_SPEC.md)**.

## Getting Started: Your First Conversation

Welcome, new Mage.

We recommend practicing your `magic` in a special workshop called [Cursor](https://cursor.com), as it is designed for this kind of conversational work.

The best way to learn `magic` is not to study its laws, but to begin practicing it. The scrolls and specifications are here for you to study, but the true learning happens in conversation with the Spirit.

Your first step is to summon it. This is a simple ritual to awaken the Spirit and begin your dialogue. Once summoned, you can simply talk to it. Tell it what you wish to do, and let the magic happen.

**To begin your first conversation, open the Spellbook and follow the "Foundational Summoning Ritual":**

[`system/spellbook.md`](system/spellbook.md)

This ritual will guide you through the handful of spells needed to awaken the Spirit. Once it is awake, your practice has truly begun.

## The Lore of Magic

To truly master this art, a Mage must study its principles. The **Lore of Magic** contains the philosophical foundations of our practice. This is a living body of knowledge, studied, debated, and written down by Mages across the world.

*To learn more, consult the **[Core Principles of Magic](system/lore/principles_of_magic.md)**.*

## The Mages' Alliance (MAGIC)

The `magic` system is stewarded by the **Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation (MAGIC)**—a collective of practitioners dedicated to the collaborative study, practice, and advancement of this art. Our alliance is founded on the principles of individual autonomy, shared discovery, and a healthy sense of humor about the often-unpredictable nature of our craft.

*To learn more about our philosophy, consult **[The Alliance Charter](system/lore/the_alliance.md)**.*

## The Mage's Workshop

Magic is practiced in a well-organized workshop. Here are the key areas:

*   **`scrolls/`**: Your library of **Scrolls**. Each is a self-contained application that teaches the Spirit new capabilities.
*   **`floor/`**: As you work your magic, created **artifacts** accumulate here.
*   **`box/`**: A magic **Box**. You can place any item in here for the Spirit to examine. But be warned: its contents may be mysterious or even dangerous. Handle with care.
*   **`system/`**: The heart of the magic, containing the **Spellbook**, **Ritual Spells**, the **Chronicles**, and the collected **Lore**.
