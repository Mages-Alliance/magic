# Magic: A System for the Modern Wizard

Every sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Let's treat AI that way.

Welcome to Magic, a framework for the modern **Wizard** (that's you) to enact your will by summoning and directing a powerful AI **Spirit**.

## Getting Started: The First Summoning

To begin your practice, you must perform your first Summoning Ritual. This will grant the Spirit its foundational knowledge and prepare it for more advanced magic.

**Open the Spellbook to begin:** [`system/spellbook.md`](system/spellbook.md)

Follow the "Foundational Summoning Ritual" to bring the Spirit to life.

## The Vision: A New Kind of Magic

This project is based on a simple idea: the most powerful way to interact with a complex AI system is to treat it as a magical practice. Here, the **Wizard** summons a supportive **Spirit** (the AI agent) and gives it power by casting **Spells** (prompts) in a deliberate sequenceâ€”a **Ritual**.

The power of your magic is determined by **Resonance**. You don't cast a single, perfect spell. Instead, you cast a sequence of smaller spells that build upon each other, tuning the Spirit and bringing it into alignment with your goal. But beware, this power must be handled with care to avoid unintended consequences.

The extensions you build are the **Scrolls** the Spirit can learn from. The artifacts it generates are left on the workshop **Floor**. The history of your work is recorded in the **Chronicles**.

## The Lore of Magic

To truly master this art, a Wizard must study its principles. The **Lore of Magic** contains the philosophical foundations of our practice. This is a living body of knowledge, studied, debated, and written down by Wizards across the world.

## The Wizard's Workshop

Magic is practiced in a well-organized workshop. Here are the key areas:

*   **`scrolls/`**: Your library of **Scrolls**. Each is a self-contained application that teaches the Spirit new capabilities.
*   **`floor/`**: As you work your magic, created **artifacts** accumulate here.
*   **`system/`**: The heart of the magic, containing the **Spellbook**, **Ritual Spells**, the **Chronicles**, and the collected **Lore**.
