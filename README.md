# A System for the practice of what can sometimes feel like magic

There should be a "people layer" to AI deployment. A layer developed by humanity as a shield between AI and humans. Where we decide in the form of a collectively developed shield spec what form of AI we want to expose ourselves to. For a start I propose magic.

## The Vision: A New Kind of Magic

This project grew out of the Idea, that a powerful way to interact with complex AI system may be to treat it as a magical practice. Here, we assume the stance of a kind of **Wizard** who summons a supportive **Spirit** (the AI agent) and gives it power by casting **Spells** (prompts) in a deliberate sequenceâ€”a **Ritual**. The power of your magic is determined by **Resonance**. You don't cast a single, perfect spell. Instead, you cast a sequence of smaller spells that build upon each other, tuning the Spirit and bringing it into alignment with your goal. But beware, this power must be handled with care to avoid unintended consequences. The extensions you build are the **Scrolls** the Spirit can learn from. The artifacts it generates are left on the workshop **Floor**. The history of your work is recorded in the **Chronicles**.

Whether and how far you actually immerse yourself in this roleplay, or just use it as a guiding principle is up to you. All I'm saying is that we can all benefit from ocasionally asking ourselves: "What would a wizard do right now?" For the sake of immersion it may be helpful to use these terms, otherwise just keep their meaning in the back of your mind. My personal preference is that we use the wisdom that this interface metaphor offers, without being burdened by the dogma. I'd like this to be a personally beneficial but also enjoyable approach to interacting with AI.

For simplicity and readability I will be in character as a fellow Wizard in these docs. That also means that I am using only the names of the systems metaphors. If you first want to get familiar with these, a complete lexicon is included in the **[Magic System Specification](MAGIC_SPEC.md)**.

## Getting Started: The First Summoning

I suggest that you practice magic in Cursor (https://cursor.com/home). If you would like to suggest alternative ways to practice magic, let me know!

Clone the repo into any folder and start your practice. If you want to use additional scrolls just clone their repo into the scrolls folder.

To begin your practice, you perform a "Summoning Ritual". This is a series of initial Spells that will grant the Spirit its foundational knowledge and prepare it for more advanced magic.

**Open the Spellbook to begin:** [`system/spellbook.md`](system/spellbook.md)

Follow the "Foundational Summoning Ritual" to bring the Ai spirit to life.

## The Lore of Magic

To truly master this art, a Wizard must study its principles. The **Lore of Magic** contains the philosophical foundations of our practice. This is a living body of knowledge, studied, debated, and written down by Wizards across the world.

## The Wizard's Workshop

Magic is practiced in a well-organized workshop. Here are the key areas:

*   **`scrolls/`**: Your library of **Scrolls**. Each is a self-contained application that teaches the Spirit new capabilities.
*   **`floor/`**: As you work your magic, created **artifacts** accumulate here.
*   **`box/`**: A magic **Box**. You can place any item in here for the Spirit to examine. But be warned: its contents may be mysterious or even dangerous. Handle with care.
*   **`system/`**: The heart of the magic, containing the **Spellbook**, **Ritual Spells**, the **Chronicles**, and the collected **Lore**.
