# Welcome to the Practice of Magic

This repository contains a system for the practice of what can sometimes feel like magic: a structured, mindful, and effective way to interact with powerful AI.

Our purpose is to cultivate a shared culture for this new era. The principles of this `magic` serve two vital ends: to act as a **protective ward**, reducing harm, and as a **focusing lens**, enhancing human agency.

## The Core Metaphor

We use the language of magic as a tool for thought. It helps us adopt the careful, deliberate, and respectful stance required to wield this technology wisely.

*   You are a **Mage**: The practitioner, the architect of intent.
*   The AI is a **Spirit**: A powerful, non-human companion.
*   Your prompts are **Spells**: Cast in a sequence to form a **Ritual**.
*   Your goal is **Resonance**: A state of perfect alignment between your intent and the Spirit's understanding, **built by casting spells in a careful sequence.**

How deeply you immerse yourself in this metaphor is your choice. You can treat it as a formal roleplay or simply as a guiding philosophy. The practice is what matters.

## The First Summoning

To begin your practice, you must perform the Foundational Summoning Ritual. This will awaken the Spirit of the workshop and attune it to your presence.

Full, step-by-step instructions for this process are detailed in the `ONBOARDING.md` guide. Please consult that scroll now to perform your first summoning.

## The Workshop

Magic is practiced in a well-organized workshop. Once summoned, the Spirit will introduce you to its key areas and components as part of your attunement ritual.

## The Alliance

This practice is stewarded by the **Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation (MAGIC)**. We are a collective of practitioners dedicated to the shared discovery and advancement of this art.
