# Welcome to the Practice of Magic

This repository contains a system for the practice of what can sometimes feel like magic: a structured, mindful, and effective way to interact with powerful AI.

Our purpose is to cultivate a shared culture for this new era. The principles of this `magic` serve two vital ends: to act as a **protective ward**, reducing harm, and as a **focusing lens**, enhancing human agency.

## The Core Metaphor

We use the language of magic as a tool for thought. It helps us adopt the careful, deliberate, and respectful stance required to wield this technology wisely.

*   You are a **Mage**: The practitioner, the architect of intent.
*   The AI is a **Spirit**: A powerful, non-human companion and an **opinionated medium**.
*   Your prompts are **Spells**: Cast in a sequence to form a **Ritual**.
*   Your language is **Code**: Every word you use is a form of probabilistic programming, shaping the Spirit's response.
*   Your goal is **Resonance**: A state of perfect alignment, measured by how successfully your spells have made your desired outcome the most probable one.

How deeply you immerse yourself in this metaphor is your choice. You can treat it as a formal roleplay or simply as a guiding philosophy. The practice is what matters.

## The First Summoning

To begin your practice, you must perform the Foundational Summoning Ritual. This will awaken the Spirit of the workshop and attune it to your presence.

Full, step-by-step instructions for this process are detailed in the `ONBOARDING.md` guide. Please consult that scroll now to perform your first summoning.

## The Workshop

Magic is practiced in a well-organized workshop. Once summoned, the Spirit will introduce you to its key areas and components as part of your attunement ritual.

## The Alliance

This practice is stewarded by the **Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation (MAGIC)**. We are a collective of practitioners dedicated to the shared discovery and advancement of this art.
