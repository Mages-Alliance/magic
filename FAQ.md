# Frequently Asked Questions about `magic`

## What is `magic`?

The short answer is that `magic` is anamorphic. it is a system that looks different, depending on your point of view. It is not one single thing, but a collection of ideas that can be approached from different angles.

Depending on your background and your goals, you might see `magic` as:

*   **A Practice:** A hands-on discipline for interacting with AI, complete with rituals, spells, and a philosophy for safe and effective use.
*   **A System:** A concrete, file-based framework for context engineering and for organizing and executing complex AI prompts and workflows.
*   **A Platform:** A foundational layer upon which other developers (Mages) can build and share their own AI-powered tools and extensions (Scrolls).
*   **An Interface Metaphor:** A powerful abstraction that uses the familiar, evocative language of magic to make the complex, abstract nature of AI more intuitive and understandable.
*   **A Mental Stance:** A deliberate way of thinking about AI that encourages creativity, caution, and a deep respect for the power of the technology.
*   **A Practical Philosophy:** A set of guiding principles for the humanistic and ethical use of AI, focused on enhancing agency and reducing harm.
*   **A Paradigm for AI Experimentation:** A structured environment for safely and repeatably experimenting with different prompting techniques and AI behaviors.
*   **An Approach to AI Alignment:** A grassroots effort to build a culture of safety and shared values from the ground up, by focusing on the human practitioner and their direct relationship with the AI.

Ultimately, `magic` is all of these things at once. It is a tool, a toy, and a treatise, designed to be whatever the practitioner needs it to be.

## What is the Mages' Alliance?

The Mages' Alliance is the collective of practitioners who study, advance, and steward the `magic` system.

Its full, formal name is **Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation (MAGIC)**.

The Alliance is founded on the principle that all members are sovereign practitioners who convene as peers to share findings and collaborate on works. It values the autonomy of the individual Mage as highly as the collective advancement of the art. Authority resides not in a council, but in the proven work of its members.
