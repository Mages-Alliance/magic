# Frequently Asked Questions about `magic`

## What is `magic`?

The short answer is that `magic` is anamorphicâ€”it is a system designed to look different depending on your point of view. It is not one single thing, but a collection of ideas that can be approached from many different angles.

Depending on your background and your goals, you might see `magic` as:

*   **A Practice:** A hands-on discipline for interacting with AI, complete with rituals, spells, and a philosophy for safe and effective use.
*   **A System:** A concrete, file-based framework for organizing and executing complex AI prompts and workflows.
*   **A Platform:** A foundational layer upon which other developers (Wizards) can build and share their own AI-powered tools and extensions (Scrolls).
*   **An Interface Metaphor:** A powerful abstraction that uses the familiar, evocative language of magic to make the complex, abstract nature of AI more intuitive and understandable.
*   **A Mental Stance:** A deliberate way of thinking about AI that encourages creativity, caution, and a deep respect for the power of the technology.
*   **A Practical Philosophy:** A set of guiding principles for the humanistic and ethical use of AI, focused on enhancing agency and reducing harm.
*   **A Paradigm for AI Experimentation:** A structured environment for safely and repeatably experimenting with different prompting techniques and AI behaviors.
*   **An Approach to AI Alignment:** A grassroots effort to build a culture of safety and shared values from the ground up, by focusing on the human practitioner and their direct relationship with the AI.

Ultimately, `magic` is all of these things at once. It is a tool, a toy, and a treatise, designed to be whatever the practitioner needs it to be.
