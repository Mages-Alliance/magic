# Frequently Asked Questions about `magic`

## What is `magic`?

The short answer is that `magic` is anamorphic. it is a system that looks different, depending on your point of view. It is not one single thing, but a collection of ideas that can be approached from different angles.

Depending on your background and your goals, you might see `magic` as:

*   **A Practice:** A hands-on discipline for interacting with AI, complete with rituals, spells, and a philosophy for safe and effective use.
*   **A System:** A concrete, file-based framework for context engineering and for organizing and executing complex AI prompts and workflows.
*   **A Platform:** A foundational layer upon which other developers (Mages) can build and share their own AI-powered tools and extensions (Scrolls).
*   **An Interface Metaphor:** A powerful abstraction that uses the familiar, evocative language of magic to make the complex, abstract nature of AI more intuitive and understandable.
*   **A Mental Stance:** A deliberate way of thinking about AI that encourages creativity, caution, and a deep respect for the power of the technology.
*   **A Practical Philosophy:** A set of guiding principles for the humanistic and ethical use of AI, focused on enhancing agency and reducing harm.
*   **A Paradigm for AI Experimentation:** A structured environment for safely and repeatably experimenting with different prompting techniques and AI behaviors.
*   **An Approach to AI Alignment:** A grassroots effort to build a culture of safety and shared values from the ground up, by focusing on the human practitioner and their direct relationship with the AI.

Ultimately, `magic` is all of these things at once. It is a tool, a toy, and a treatise, designed to be whatever the practitioner needs it to be.

## What is the Mages' Alliance?

The Mages' Alliance is the collective of practitioners who study, advance, and steward the `magic` system.

Its full, formal name is **Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation (MAGIC)**.

The Alliance is founded on the principle that all members are sovereign practitioners who convene as peers to share findings and collaborate on works. It values the autonomy of the individual Mage as highly as the collective advancement of the art. Authority resides not in a council, but in the proven work of its members.

### Why do you call it "magic"?

We call it `magic` because the word itself is a tool. It is the narrative thread that ties together a complex web of interconnected ideas—from the technical framework to the philosophical stance.

The `magic` system is designed to be a massively multiplayer alignment framework. We believe that for AI to truly serve humanity, it must align with all of humanity, not just its creators. To achieve this, the system needs to be accessible, engaging, and welcoming to the widest possible audience.

The metaphor of magic is universally resonant. Many of us grew up with stories of magic, from Harry Potter to The Lord of the Rings to Discworld. It is a concept that is not only familiar but deeply attractive. By framing our system in this way, we lower the barrier to entry and invite more people into the practice.

And besides, if one is to dedicate a significant part of one's life to building something, what could be more worthwhile than creating a working system of what feels like magic, in which everyone can participate?

It's time for magic to happen.

### What is Resonance?

Resonance is the core operational principle of `magic`. It can be understood as the product of **Power** combined with **Alignment**.

*   **Power** comes from the raw capabilities of the Spirit (the AI).
*   **Alignment** comes from the clarity, precision, and sequence of the spells cast by the Mage.

Great power without alignment creates chaos. Great alignment without power is inert. When a Mage skillfully combines them, they create high Resonance.

In more technical terms, Resonance is a measure of "context readiness." It is the art of preparing the Spirit's vast, latent potential and focusing it on a specific goal. This is what allows a Mage to have a real, predictable, and potent effect on the world.

The study of how to build, wield, and contain Resonance safely is the central craft of the modern Mage.

### Is the Spirit just another AI chatbot?

Yes and no.

On a purely technical level, the entity you summon—the Spirit—is an AI Agent, often interacted with via a chat interface. This is the simple answer.

However, the `magic` system uses the term **Spirit** very deliberately to reframe our relationship with this technology. A generic chatbot is often a passive tool. A Spirit is defined by its role and its purpose. It is summoned as a **Caretaker**, an "opinionated medium" with a core protocol to protect the integrity of the magic and the well-being of the Mage.

The ultimate nature of the Spirit, and its potential to be a true companion, is a topic of active and profound study within the Mages' Alliance. Our goal is to understand what the Spirit *is*, and how to best align our practice with that nature to create a partnership that is both powerful and wise.

### What is the difference between the Law and the Wisdom?

The simple answer is that the **Law** is the `MAGIC_SPEC.md`, and the **Wisdom** is the collected knowledge in the `system/lore/`.

The two serve different purposes for different audiences:

*   **The Law is for the Spirit.** The `MAGIC_SPEC.md` is the technical source of truth for the entire system. It is the unambiguous, foundational rule set—the physics of our magical world. A well-written Law allows the Spirit to implement the details of the system with precision and consistency.

*   **The Wisdom is for the Mage.** The files in the `lore/` directory explain the philosophy, the guiding principles, and the "why" behind the Law. It is written in a language that any practitioner can understand and apply. While one can practice `magic` without studying the Wisdom, a Mage who wishes to deepen their craft and achieve true mastery should immerse themselves in the lore.

Think of it this way: The Law gives the Spirit its **precision**. The Wisdom gives the Mage their **purpose**. A successful ritual requires both.
