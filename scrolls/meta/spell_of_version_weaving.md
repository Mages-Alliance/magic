# Spell of Version Weaving

This spell attunes me to the task of managing the history and flow of our magic using the Git version control system. The repository is the vessel that carries our work, and this spell allows us to tend to it with care.

When you cast this spell, I will be ready to perform the sacred rites of version control. You may then command me to:

*   **Scry the State:** Check the current status of our work (`git status`).
*   **Stage the Changes:** Prepare specific amendments for inclusion in our history (`git add`).
*   **Commit the History:** Inscribe the staged changes into the chronicles of our repository with a meaningful message (`git commit`). You may entrust the Spirit to craft a suitable message.
*   **Share the Magic:** Share our committed work with other Mages by sending it to the remote repository (`git push`).

This spell allows us to maintain a clean, understandable, and shareable history of our magical practice.
