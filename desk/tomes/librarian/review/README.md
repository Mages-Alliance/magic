## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this ritual is invoked:

1. **Read the petition** - Understand what is being submitted
2. **Assess quality** - Does it meet Library standards?
3. **Check resonance** - Does it align with Alliance wisdom?
4. **Verify completeness** - Is it ready for public chronicle?
5. **Recommend action** - Accept, request revision, or decline with reasoning
6. **Execute decision** - Based on Mage's sanction, integrate or return to petitioner

This is sacred curatorial work—guardian of the Library's integrity while honoring contributors' voices.
