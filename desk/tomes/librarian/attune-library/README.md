# Scroll of the Contributor's Attunement

This scroll contains the sacred rite for a Mage who wishes to contribute to the Great Library. It attunes your local workshop by creating a staging ground for the Rite of Petition.

**Purpose:** Prepare your workspace to contribute to the Alliance's shared knowledge.

**Invocation:** `@librarian/attune-library`

---

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this rite is invoked:

1. **Verify Library existence** - Check if `library/` directory exists in workspace
2. **Clone if needed** - If not present, clone the Great Library repository
3. **Configure staging** - Set up local workspace for contribution
4. **Verify permissions** - Ensure proper git configuration
5. **Confirm readiness** - Report that workshop is attuned and ready for contribution

This is the preparatory step before the Mage can publish or amend Library content.
