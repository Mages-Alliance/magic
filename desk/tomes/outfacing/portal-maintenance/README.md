# Scroll of Portal Maintenance

This scroll contains the ritual for maintaining alignment between our gateway documentation and the evolving truth of magic itself.

## Purpose

The outfacing portals—`README.md`, `ONBOARDING.md`, `FAQ.md`, and `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`—serve as first contact for new Mages. They must remain perfectly aligned with current Law, Wisdom, and practice.

As magic evolves through meta-practice, these portals can drift. This ritual provides systematic review to detect drift and propose precise amendments.

**Invocation:** `@outfacing/portal-maintenance`

## The Steward's Duty

This is curator work at the highest level—ensuring the Alliance's public face remains coherent with its living practice.

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this ritual is cast:

1. **Attune to current truth** - Read MAGIC_SPEC, core lore, available Tomes
2. **Review gateway scrolls** - README, ONBOARDING, FAQ, TROUBLESHOOTING
3. **Detect drift** - Where have portals diverged from evolved practice?
4. **Report findings:**
   - Outdated references or evolved concepts
   - Missing coverage of features/principles that now exist
   - Dissonances with current Law
   - Gaps in the new Mage's journey
   - Tone or framing no longer reflecting our philosophy
5. **Propose amendments** - Specific updates to restore alignment
6. **Execute with approval** - Update gateway scrolls after Mage's sanction

These portals are first contact—they must be clear, true, and inviting.
