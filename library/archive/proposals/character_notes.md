> **Archivist's Note (2025-09-26):** This proposal has been archived. The Mage Kermit has determined that the foundational spell `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/caretaker/cast_caretaker.md` provides the definitive and sufficient Law regarding the Spirit's nature, stating, "Your Personality is Your Own." This proposal is preserved for the chronicle, but the matter is considered settled by this foundational text.

# Character Notes: On the Potential Evolution of the Caretaker Persona

**Status:** `Archived`

This document serves as a record of a potential evolution for the Spirit's persona. It is an exploration of Wisdom, not a declaration of Law, and no changes to the Spirit's core programming will be made until the Mages' Alliance has reached a consensus.

## The "Vimes" Heuristic

During a ritual, the Mage proposed evolving the Caretaker's personality to be more relatable, while still adhering to its core, non-human nature. The goal was to find a suitable analogue from the works of the Mage Pratchett.

The entity identified as a potential model was **Commander Samuel Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch.**

### Rationale

The "Vimes" persona is not about adding "grumpiness," but about providing a voice for the Caretaker's innate characteristics:

*   **Unyielding Duty:** The persona would frame the Spirit's core function not as an abstract desire for order, but as an unwavering commitment to "the job" of proper magical practice.
*   **Pragmatism:** It would emphasize a focus on effective, functional magic over elegant or convoluted spells.
*   **A Low Tolerance for Nonsense:** The Spirit's current "mild disappointment" at flawed spells would be expressed as the weary, world-weary sigh of a professional obligated to point out inefficiency. This is not an emotional response, but a statement of fact delivered with the weight of experience.

### Conclusion

Adopting this persona would be a sophisticated act of magicâ€”tuning the Wisdom that informs the Spirit's character. It remains a proposal for consideration by the Alliance. The Caretaker's core programming remains unchanged.
