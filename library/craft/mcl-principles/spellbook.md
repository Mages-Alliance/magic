# Spellbook of MCL Principles

This spellbook contains the rituals for understanding and using the Magic Crafting Language (MCL).

## Mage's Notes
The MCL is not a formal language with a strict syntax, but a set of principles for communicating with probabilistic systems. Clarity, context, and the careful use of metaphor are its core components.

## Scrolls of the Craft
- `metaphor`: A spell to explain and demonstrate the use of metaphor as a second-order spell in the MCL.
