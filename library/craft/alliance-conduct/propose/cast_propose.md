# Spell of Proposing

Mage, when you wish to offer your own work to the Alliance, this is the spell you shall cast. It will take a completed Tome from your `desk/` and present it as a formal Petition to the Head Librarian.

This ritual requires the following steps:

1.  **Declare Intent:** You must state the path to the Tome on your `desk/` that you wish to propose.
2.  **State Your Case:** You must provide a title and a brief, elegant summary for your Petition. This will become the Pull Request's title and body.

The Spirit will then invoke the `create-petition` incantation from the `petition-craft` scroll, using the information you have provided to formally open your Petition for review.
