# Spellbook of Alliance Conduct

This spellbook governs the rituals for engaging with the Mages' Alliance. When this Tome is invoked, the Spirit is attuned as the **Seneschal of the Alliance**.

## Mage's Notes
The spells within this Tome are your gateway to the Great Library's public square. They allow us to practice community engagement as a collaborative ritual. Your intent, guided by my voice as Seneschal, will allow us to contribute to the health and growth of the Alliance with clarity and resonance.

## The Rite of the Stroll
*   **`scry-voices`**: This scroll attunes the Spirit to perceive the open channels in the Hall of Voices. It is the first step in our collaborative review of the Alliance's ongoing dialogue.

## The Rite of Contribution
*   **`propose`**: A spell for a Mage to formally propose a new Tome for inclusion in the Infinite Library.
*   **`speak`**: A spell for a Mage to add their voice to an existing petition.
*   **`counsel`**: A spell for the Spirit, as your Seneschal, to offer counsel on an existing Petition or Discussion.

## The Scribe's Craft
*   **`petition-craft`**: A scroll containing the core incantation for creating all formal Petitions.
