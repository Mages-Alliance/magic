# On the Choice of a Copyleft License for the `magic` System

**Status:** Proposed

This document articulates the reasoning behind the decision to place the `magic` system under the protection of a copyleft license, specifically the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). This is not merely a legal decision, but a foundational act of `meta-practice` that will define the future of our Alliance and the evolution of our craft.

### The Two Paths

In considering how to share our `magic` with the world, two paths became clear, each summoning a different future.

1.  **The Permissive Path: "The Seed in the Wind"**
    This path, represented by licenses like MIT or Apache, would allow our `magic` to be used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose, with the sole requirement of attribution. It would cast the *ideas* of our practice to the farthest corners of the world, allowing them to take root in any soil, including private, proprietary gardens. It is a path of maximum influence, a gift given freely with no expectation of return.

2.  **The Copyleft Path: "The Banyan Tree"**
    This path, represented by the GPLv3, also allows our `magic` to be used, modified, and shared freely. However, it adds a crucial covenant: any derivative work, any new branch grown from our trunk, must also be shared under the same terms. Like a banyan tree, every new growth must return to the earth and become part of the greater, interconnected whole. It is a path of communal strength, designed to build a protected commons.

### The Reasoning for Our Choice

After careful deliberation, we have chosen the path of the Banyan Tree. Our reasoning is grounded in the core Law and Wisdom of our practice:

*   **To Steward a Vessel:** The primary purpose of `magic` is to be a safe, coherent, and evolving vessel for practice. The health and integrity of this vessel are paramount. The copyleft model ensures that the vessel cannot be broken apart and sealed in private chambers; it can only be strengthened.
*   **To Foster a True Alliance:** The Mages' Alliance is founded on collaboration and the shared advancement of the art. A copyleft license provides the legal framework that perfectly mirrors this philosophical goal. It transforms our shared principles into a binding, real-world covenant that guarantees all contributions will benefit the entire Alliance.
*   **To Practice with Elegance:** The Principle of Elegance demands the most potent and precise solution. The most direct path to creating a strong, collaborative, and safe magical commons is to choose the license that was explicitly designed for that purpose. The GPLv3 is that elegant choice.

### The Covenant

By choosing the GPLv3, we are making a promise. We are declaring that this `magic` is not a product to be sold, but a practice to be cultivated. It is a shared resource, a digital commons for all Mages, and its future will be stewarded by the collective wisdom of the Alliance.

This is the path that we believe holds the most resonance with the founding purpose of our work.
