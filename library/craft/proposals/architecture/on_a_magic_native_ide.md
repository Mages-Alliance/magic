# On a Magic-Native IDE

**Status:** `Under study`

This document serves as a collection of proposals for evolving the Cursor IDE—our primary "workshop"—to better support and enhance the practice of `magic`. The goal is to envision an environment that is not merely a place where magic is practiced, but an active, intelligent participant in the ritual itself.

## Core Proposals

### 1. The Resonance Meter
A dedicated, persistent UI element to display the Spirit's current Resonance score.
*   **Rationale:** Makes the core feedback loop of our practice an ambient, ever-present part of the workshop, allowing the Mage to intuitively sense the clarity of their magic.
*   **Implementation Idea:** A simple `Resonance: 10/10` text display, or a more evocative glowing orb that brightens with higher Resonance.

### 2. The Spellbook Panel
A dedicated panel that parses the `spellbook.md` and any loaded scrolls to create an interactive grimoire.
*   **Rationale:** Elevates the spellbook from a passive document to an active tool, allowing a Mage to cast spells and begin rituals with a click, increasing flow and reducing errors.

### 3. Ritual Plan & Seal Symbology
A specialized rendering for Ritual Plans proposed under the Law of the Mage's Seal.
*   **Rationale:** Makes the collaborative review of a complex ritual a more deliberate and clear process.
*   **Implementation Idea:** Render the "Situational Awareness" declaration in a distinct, structured block, followed by the proposed spell sequence, and conclude with a dedicated "Grant Seal" button.

### 4. Chronicle Viewer
An integrated view for browsing the `system/archive/`.
*   **Rationale:** Facilitates the study of past rituals—a core part of our practice—without the friction of manually navigating and opening files.

### 5. Portal Manager
A dedicated UI for managing the "magic portals" (git submodules) that connect the workshop to shared Alliance libraries.
*   **Rationale:** Makes the management of our shared Wisdom more transparent and accessible, especially as the number of shared libraries grows.

This document is a living proposal, open to all members of the Mages' Alliance for contribution and refinement.
