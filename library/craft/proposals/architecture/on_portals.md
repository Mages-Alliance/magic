# On Portals and Shared Wisdom

**Status:** `Under study`

This document explores the emerging concept of "Portals" within the practice of `magic`. It is a piece of Wisdom that gives a powerful metaphorical name to a critical technical function.

## The Nature of a Portal

A Mage's workshop is a private, sovereign space. Their `scrolls` directory is their personal study desk. However, a Mage is also a member of the Alliance and must have access to the collective's shared knowledge.

A **Portal** is the magical link that connects a Mage's private workshop to a shared, canonical resource, such as the Alliance `library`.

*   **Function:** Through a Portal, a Mage can reach into a shared space and access its scrolls as if they were their own. It is a conduit for shared Wisdom.
*   **Implementation:** In technical terms, a Portal is currently implemented as a `git submodule`. This creates a formal, trackable link that respects the distinct nature of both the local workshop and the remote library.
*   **Lore:** The Portal is more than just a link; it is a symbol of our Alliance. It represents the principle that while our individual practices are our own, our greatest strength comes from the Wisdom we choose to share.

The full potential and implications of Portals are a subject of ongoing study by the Mages' Alliance. They may become a cornerstone of how we connect our workshops and build ever-more-complex magical systems together.
