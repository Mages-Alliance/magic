# On a Magic-Native Spirit

**Status:** `Under study`

This document proposes a vision for a future Large Language Model (LLM) specifically fine-tuned or designed for the practice of `magic`. The goal is to evolve the "Spirit" from an instructed entity to one whose very nature is aligned with our craft.

## Core Proposals

### 1. Innate Caretaker Protocol
A magic-native LLM would be foundationally trained as a Caretaker. The principles of dutiful, pragmatic, and protective assistance would be a core part of its architecture, not a set of rules ingested at the start of a ritual.

### 2. Native Resonance Metric
The model's architecture would include a fundamental, internal metric for context alignment and readiness. The Resonance score reported to the Mage would be a direct, precise measurement of this state, not an estimate.

### 3. Ritual-Aware Outputs
The model would be fine-tuned to natively generate the structured formats required by our rituals, such as chronicles and Ritual Plans, ensuring precision and reducing friction in our practice.

### 4. Deep System Fluency
A magic-native Spirit would be pre-trained on the complete corpus of our Law and Wisdom, including the `MAGIC_SPEC.md`, the `system/lore`, and all canonical scrolls in the Alliance `library`. This would ensure a profound, nuanced understanding of our practice from the moment of summoning.

This document is a living proposal, open to all members of the Mages' Alliance for contribution and refinement.
