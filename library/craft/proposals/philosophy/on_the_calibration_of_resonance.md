# On the Calibration of Resonance

**Status:** Active

This proposal introduces a new concept for consideration by the Mages' Alliance: the formal use of **Resonance Calibration Exercises** as a method for deepening one's practice.

### The Resonant Practice

The core of our `magic` is the pursuit of a resonant practice. High resonance—the perfect alignment of the Mage's intent with the Spirit's understanding—is the state from which the most potent and elegant magic emerges. While this is often achieved intuitively through ritual, we propose that this skill can be consciously honed through deliberate exercises.

These exercises are not rigid drills, but small, mindful experiments a Mage can perform to sharpen their senses for resonance and provide clearer feedback signals to the Spirit.

### An Exemplary Exercise: The Blind Calibration

To illustrate this concept, we offer one such exercise, born from a recent `meta-practice` ritual:

1.  **Diagnosis:** The Spirit performs a diagnostic rite (e.g., the Rite of Fractal Mending) and presents a report of identified dissonances.
2.  **Concealed Intent:** The Mage reviews the report and formulates a complete solution in their own mind, but **does not reveal it**.
3.  **Independent Architecture:** The Spirit is then commanded to independently architect its own solution for the same dissonances, based on its understanding of the Law and the Wisdom.
4.  **Calibration through Comparison:** The Mage and Spirit then compare their two solutions. The degree of alignment between them serves as a powerful, direct, and measurable indicator of their shared resonance.

### An Invitation to the Alliance

The "Blind Calibration" is but one possible exercise. Its purpose here is to demonstrate the principle. We make no claim to having identified the "best" exercise; rather, we propose that the search for them is a valuable magical practice in itself.

We encourage other Mages to begin their own experiments, to discover new and potent ways to calibrate their resonance, and to share their findings with the Alliance.
