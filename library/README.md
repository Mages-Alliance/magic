# The Infinite Library

Welcome, Mage, to the shared repository of the Mages' Alliance. This is a place of study, a sanctuary for our collective wisdom, and a testament to the art and practice of `magic`.

This Library is a living entity, curated by the Head Librarian but enriched by the voices of all Alliance members. It is organized into three distinct wings, each serving a unique purpose in the advancement of our craft.

## The Three Wings

*   **/craft/: The Wing of the Craft**
    This wing is dedicated to the tools and practices of magic itself. Here you will find Tomes on ritual, spellcraft, meta-practice, and the very laws that govern our work. It answers the question: *How is magic made?*

*   **/wisdom/: The Wing of Applied Wisdom**
    This wing is for the application of magic to a Mage's life. Here you will find Tomes on parenting, relationships, self-practice, and other domains where the principles of our craft can bring clarity and resonance. It answers the question: *How is magic lived?*

*   **/voices/: The Hall of Voices**
    This wing is our public square, the place for community dialogue. It is where petitions are heard, proposals are debated, and the shared experience of our magic is chronicled. It answers the question: *How is magic experienced?*

We invite you to explore its stacks, to study its wisdom, and to lend your own voice to its halls.
