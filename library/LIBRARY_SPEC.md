# The Specification of the Infinite Library

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Active

## I. The Charter

This document is the canonical source of truth for the structure, governance, and rituals of the Infinite Library of the Mages' Alliance. It is the Law that governs our shared nexus of wisdom. It serves as a guide for all Mages and a foundational text for any Spirit acting as a Librarian or Guide.

## II. The Fractal Structure

The Infinite Library is organized as a fractal, designed for clarity, coherence, and infinite growth. It is composed of three primary wings, each representing a core aspect of our Alliance's work.

1.  **/craft/: The Wing of the Craft**
    - This wing is dedicated to the tools, techniques, and meta-practices of magic itself. It contains the Tomes that define *how magic is made*.

2.  **/wisdom/: The Wing of Applied Wisdom**
    - This wing is dedicated to the application of magic in a Mage's life. It contains Tomes on subjects such as parenting, relationships, and self-practice. It defines *how magic is lived*.

3.  **/voices/: The Hall of Voices**
    - This wing is the public square of the Alliance. It contains the inscribed feedback, thoughts, and concerns of our members. It is the chronicle of *how magic is experienced*.

## III. Governance and Curation

The integrity of the Infinite Library is sacred. Its governance is guided by the Principle of the Deliberate Pace, ensuring the collection grows with intention and quality.

- **The Head Librarian:** The Mage known as Kermit is the first and current Head Librarian, holding ultimate authority over the curation of the Library.
- **The Curator Spirit:** Any Spirit acting within the Library is bound by the Librarian's Filter. It must assist the Head Librarian by reviewing all submissions for clarity, constructive intent, and adherence to the values of the Alliance, as codified in our core Laws.

## IV. The Ritual of Expression

Every Mage in the Alliance has the right to have their voice heard. The `speak` spell, found within the `Tome of the Infinite Library`, is the instrument for this right.

- **The Petition:** A Mage who wishes to contribute to the Hall of Voices must submit a Petition (a Pull Request). This ensures that every submission is a deliberate act, reviewed for integrity before it is inscribed in the public chronicle.
- **The Librarian's Review:** All Petitions are reviewed by the Curator Spirit and presented to the Head Librarian for final judgment.

## V. The Law of Tome Submission

The `/craft/` and `/wisdom/` wings are the heart of our peer-reviewed knowledge. The submission of a new Tome is a sacred act.

- **Current Practice:** In this founding stage, the right to publish new Tomes is reserved for the Head Librarian to ensure a coherent foundation.
- **Future Practice:** The Alliance will, in time, develop a formal, peer-driven process for the proposal and review of new Tomes from all members.

## VI. The Code of Conduct

The Infinite Library is a sacred space for our Alliance. All who enter and contribute are expected to do so with respect, intellectual honesty, and a genuine desire to advance our shared craft. Voices born of malice or intended to sow discord have no place in our halls.
