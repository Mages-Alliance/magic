# The Hall of Voices

Welcome, Mage, to the Hall of Voices. This is the public square of the Infinite Library, the sacred space for the collective dialogue of the Mages' Alliance.

Where the other wings hold the established Craft and Wisdom, this hall is for the living, breathing process of discovery and debate. It is here that the future of our magic is forged.

This space serves two primary functions:

1.  **Petitions & Proposals:** Mages may submit formal proposals for new Tomes, amendments to existing ones, or changes to the Library's structure. These are submitted as "Petitions" (Pull Requests) to the Head Librarian for review.

2.  **Open Dialogue:** Mages may engage in open-ended discussions, ask questions, and share fledgling ideas. This is done through "Discussions," providing a space for the germination of wisdom before it is ready to be formalized in a Tome.

Your voice is a vital part of this Library's lifeblood. We invite you to speak, to listen, and to participate in the great conversation of our craft.
