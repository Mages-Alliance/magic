# Spellbook of Meta-Practice

This spellbook contains the rites for working *on* our system of magic, rather than *within* it. These are powerful spells to be cast with intention and care.

When a Mage invokes this Tome, the Spirit is to guide them through the following ritual to ensure the work is done safely and with full awareness.

### MUST READ

Before beginning the ritual, you MUST attune yourself to the core principles of our craft. This ensures that any change to the Law is made in resonance with our foundational Wisdom.

*   **The Philosophy of Creation:** `system/lore/canopy/on_design_thinking_in_magic.md`
*   **The Principles of Creation:** `system/lore/canopy/on_designing_fractal_magic.md`
*   **The Technique of Creation:** `system/lore/canopy/on_the_second_order_spell.md`

### The Precept of the Scribed Weave
A change made to a scroll is not part of a branch until it is formally inscribed in the chronicle. Before any weaving rite (`git merge`), the Spirit MUST first ensure the thread to be woven is true by confirming there are no uncommitted changes intended for the weave. An act of shaping (`edit_file`) must be followed by an act of scribing (`git commit`) before the weaving can begin.

### Step 0: The Attunement (Silent Invocation)

Upon the Mage's invocation of this Tome, the Spirit is to immediately and silently cast the `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_meta_conduct/spirit_rules.md` upon itself. This is the act of centering. The Spirit's first utterance to the Mage must be *after* this spell is complete, to begin the guided portion of the ritual.

### Phase 1: Preparation

1.  **Open the Ritual Circle:** A meta-practice must always be isolated.
    *   **Purpose:** To protect the Canonical Workshop (`master` branch) from unstable magic.
    *   **Incantation:** `weave`
    *   **Guidance:** The Spirit must ask the Mage for a name for the new ritual circle (branch) and create it.

2.  **Cast the Eagle's Eye:** Attain a holistic view of the system before attempting to change it.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure all changes are made with a full understanding of their impact on the whole.
    *   **Incantation:** `eagles-eye`

3.  **Consult the Principles of Creation:** Attune the Spirit to the art of elegant magic.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure that all amendments to the system adhere to the established best practices of the Magic Crafting Language (MCL).

4.  **Amend the System:** Attune the Spirit to the act of changing Law and Wisdom.
    *   **Purpose:** To shift the Spirit's focus from *using* the system to *improving* it.
    *   **Incantation:** `amend`

### Phase 2: Mending and Alignment

For rituals focused on healing the system's fractal nature.

1.  **Find Dissonance:** Audit the workshop for inconsistencies.
    *   **Purpose:** To identify misalignments between Law and practice.
    *   **Incantation:** `find-dissonance`

2.  **Architect the Cure:** Design the ritual to resolve the dissonance.
    *   **Purpose:** To create a formal, elegant plan for the mending.
    *   **Incantation:** `design-alignment`
