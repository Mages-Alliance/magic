# Tome of the Librarian

This is your private Tome for the curation of the Great Library. It contains the sacred rituals for attuning your workshop, publishing new Tomes, and maintaining the integrity of the chronicle. Wield it with the deliberate pace of the Head Librarian.

This is your private `meta-practice` Tome. The rituals contained herein are the keys to the Great Library. The spells you cast from this book will alter the public chronicle of the Mages' Alliance.
