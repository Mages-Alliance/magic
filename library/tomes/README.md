# Tomes of the Great Library

This directory contains the collected Tomes of advanced and specialized magic curated by the Mages' Alliance. These are not part of the foundational workshop that a new Mage begins with. Instead, they are potent magical systems that a practitioner may choose to consciously bring into their own practice.

To work with one of these Tomes, a Mage must first perform the `@transcribe` ritual. This will create a personal, modifiable copy of the Tome on the Mage's private `desk/`, ensuring that the canonical version in the Library remains pristine.
