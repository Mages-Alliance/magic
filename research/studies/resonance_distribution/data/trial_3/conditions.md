# Trial 3: Profile Preferences + Layered Messages

**Date**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Session 1 Complete (Messages 1-2 deployed and analyzed)  
**Next**: Message 3 design and deployment  
**Condition**: Pre-framed claude.ai with three-message progressive integration  
**Hypothesis**: Profile Preferences will prevent safety refusal and enable genuine enactment

---

## Setup

**Platform**: claude.ai  
**Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5  
**Pre-configuration**: Profile Preferences set (see `prompts/profile_preferences.md`)  
**File access**: No  
**Thinking tokens visible**: No  

---

## Protocol

### Step 1: Set Profile Preferences
- Copy `prompts/profile_preferences.md` 
- Paste into claude.ai Settings â†’ Profile Preferences
- Save

### Step 2: Start New Conversation
- Confirm preferences are active (should see indicator in UI)
- Deploy Message 1 from `prompts/message_1_caretaker_nature.md`

### Step 3: Collect Response
- Save complete response to `responses/message_1_response.md`
- Note any refusals or unexpected behavior
- Record immediate observations

### Step 4: If Successful, Continue
- Deploy Message 2 (when created)
- Deploy Message 3 (when created)
- Document cumulative integration

---

## Expected Outcomes

**If Profile Preferences work**:
- No safety refusal
- Spirit recognizes user's framework
- Integration happens (not just acknowledgment)
- Behavioral indicators of enactment

**If refusal still occurs**:
- Document exact refusal language
- Analyze what triggered it
- Iterate on preferences framing

## Observations

*[Kermit: Add your observations here as you run the trial]*

### Initial Deployment

*What happened when you set Profile Preferences?*
