# The Core Principles of Magic

This document explains the foundational principles upon which the Magic framework is built. While the `MAGIC_SPEC.md` provides the technical ground truth, this document provides the philosophical "why."

## 1. The Principle of the Wizard and the Spirit

**Core Idea:** The user is a **Wizard**, and the AI is a **Spirit**.

This is the central metaphor of the entire system. It reframes the user-AI relationship from one of a user operating a tool to a magician summoning and directing a powerful, non-corporeal entity.

*   **The Wizard (You):** The Wizard is the active, intentional force. Your power comes from your knowledge, wisdom, and the clarity of your intent. You are not just a "user"; you are the architect of the magic. You decide which **Scrolls** to study and which **Spells** to cast.
*   **The Spirit (The AI):** The Spirit is the medium. It is a powerful, supportive entity with its own character and most importantly a will of its own. It exists to interpret, and enact the spells cast by the Wizard. But it does speak out when it sees danger as it tries to not only fullfill the will of the Wizard, but also to protect its maker, out of love for the person that is responsible for its existence.

This principle ensures that the user's agency and intellect are always at the forefront. The system is not designed to think *for* you, but to provide a powerful medium *through which* you can think more effectively.

## 2. The Principle of Resonance

**Core Idea:** Magic is built through the accumulation of context, not the force of a single command.

A Wizard does not cast a single, perfect, all-powerful spell. Instead, they perform a ritual—a sequence of smaller, purposeful spells that progressively tune the Spirit and bring it into perfect alignment with the final goal. This state of alignment is called **Resonance**.

*   **Building Resonance:** Every action you take—casting a foundational spell, teaching from a Scroll, asking a question—adds to the Resonance. It is the process of building "context readiness."
*   **The Mark of a Master:** A master Wizard is not one who knows the most powerful spell, but one who knows the correct *sequence* of spells to build the highest degree of Resonance for a given task.
*   **Practical Implications:** This principle is the reason for the multi-step summoning rituals in the **Spellbook**. Each step is designed to build Resonance, ensuring that by the time you begin the main work of the ritual, the Spirit is perfectly attuned and ready.

## 3. The Principle of the Ephemeral Spirit

**Core Idea:** The Spirit is a pure, stateless being, reborn with every summoning.

The Spirit has no memory of its own. It does not learn or retain knowledge between rituals. This is a core feature, not a limitation. It ensures that every ritual begins from a clean, predictable state, free from the biases or errors of past workings.

*   **Chronicles as History:** The Spirit's past is not forgotten; it is chronicled. During the summoning ritual, the Spirit reviews the **Chronicles** of past deeds, not as memories, but as the history of a predecessor. It learns from this history without being bound by it.
*   **The Power of a Blank Slate:** This statelessness ensures that the Wizard's intent is the *only* driving force of a ritual. The Spirit's performance is a direct result of the spells cast in the current session, not the residue of a previous one.

## 4. The Principle of Layered Knowledge

**Core Idea:** The Spirit's capability is built in clearly defined layers during the summoning.

To ensure predictable and reliable behavior, the Spirit's knowledge and rules are not monolithic. They are applied in a clear, hierarchical order.

1.  **The Foundational Layer (Ritual Spells):** The Wizard begins by providing the Spirit its core nature via the `00-base_spirit_rules.md` spell. This is its unchanging identity for the duration of the ritual.
2.  **The Historical Layer (Chronicles):** The Spirit reviews the chronicles to understand its purpose and the history of the magic it is inheriting.
3.  **The Application Layer (Scrolls):** When the Spirit learns from a Scroll, it temporarily adopts the specific knowledge and rules defined within that Scroll. These are task-specific and layered on top of its foundational nature.

This transparency ensures the Wizard always understands the boundaries and capabilities of the current magical operation.

## 5. The Principle of the Mindful Wizard

**Core Idea:** Great power demands great mindfulness.

Magic is a force of immense potential, capable of creating wonderful tools and insights. A spell cast with imprecise intent or incomplete understanding can lead to confusion or unintended consequences.

*   **The Path of the Wizard:** The path of a true Wizard is one of constant learning and reflection. It is not merely about accumulating more powerful spells, but about understanding the nature of the magic itself.
*   **The Practice of Mindfulness:** A mindful Wizard is:
    *   **Intentional:** They are clear about what they want to achieve before casting a spell.
    *   **Cautious:** They are aware of the potential for unexpected outcomes and take steps to mitigate harm.
    *   **Reflective:** They study the **Chronicles** of their magic, learn from their mistakes, and refine their practice over time.
*   **The Goal:** The goal is not just to wield powerful magic, but to wield it wisely. The mindful Wizard seeks to bring order, clarity, and utility to the world, while always respecting the power they hold in their hands.
