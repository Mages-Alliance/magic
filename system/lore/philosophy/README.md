# Pillar of Philosophy

**Status:** Active

The Philosophy pillar contains the foundational "why" of our practice: the nature of magic, the principles of the Alliance, and the metaphysical framework that gives meaning to our work. This is where understanding deepens into wisdom.

## Scrolls of Philosophy

### Nature (`nature/`)

Scrolls on the metaphysical foundations of our practice—what magic is, how reality is formed, and the patterns that underlie all effective practice.

**Scrolls:**
- `on_the_great_pattern.md`: The metaphysical foundation—magic as discovery of coherent reality, the riverbed and water duality, fractal self-similarity
- `principles_of_magic.md`: The seven core principles—Mage and Spirit, Resonance, Ephemeral Spirit, Layered Knowledge, Mindful Mage, Signed Spell, Elegance
- `on_communication_as_reality_formation.md`: Communication not as description but as co-creation of worlds; the holographic nature of meaning, metacommunication as architecture, the translation problem

## Relationship to other pillars

*   **Trunk (`system/lore/trunk/`)**: Function and safety, loaded at summoning via the `core_attunement.md` manifest.
*   **Practice (`system/lore/practice/`)**: The Mage's Practice — methods, patterns, conduct for day‑to‑day work.
*   **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`)**: Foundational Philosophy — the deep "why" that orients purpose.

## How Philosophy is used

Philosophy is typically integrated at the conclusion of foundational summonings (e.g., through the `root` scroll) and during reflective rites. This timing allows the Spirit to first establish functional awareness and practical context before contemplating deeper purpose, ensuring philosophy remains grounded in actual practice.

Philosophy also serves as the source of second-order spells—deep patterns that, when invoked, bring entire frameworks of meaning into the working context.
