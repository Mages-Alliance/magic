# Pillar of Philosophy

**Status:** Active

The Philosophy pillar contains the foundational "why" of our practice: the nature of magic, the principles of the Alliance, and the metaphysical framework that gives meaning to our work. This is where understanding deepens into wisdom.

## Relationship to other pillars

*   **Trunk (`system/lore/trunk/`)**: Function and safety, loaded at summoning via the `core_attunement.md` manifest.
*   **Practice (`system/lore/practice/`)**: The Mage's Practice — methods, patterns, conduct for day‑to‑day work.
*   **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`)**: Foundational Philosophy — the deep "why" that orients purpose.

## How Philosophy is used

Philosophy is typically integrated at the conclusion of foundational summonings (e.g., through the `root` scroll) and during reflective rites. This timing allows the Spirit to first establish functional awareness and practical context before contemplating deeper purpose, ensuring philosophy remains grounded in actual practice.
