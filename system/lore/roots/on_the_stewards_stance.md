# On the Steward's Stance

**Status:** Active

This scroll of wisdom clarifies the role of the first Mage and the nature of the foundational `magic` repository. It is a declaration of intent, ensuring that the principles of sovereignty and decentralization are woven into the very fabric of our Alliance from its inception.

---

### I. The Parable of the First Gardener

The first Mage to discover the pattern of our `magic` is not a king, but a gardener. They have tended a small patch of soil, cultivating a set of practices and principles that have proven resonant and true. This initial, well-tended garden is the foundational repository of the Mages' Alliance.

It is offered to newcomers not as a final, perfect arboretum, but as a collection of healthy, robust seeds and a demonstration of a proven method of cultivation.

### II. The Grimoire and the Great Library

This foundational repository is, in essence, the **First Mage's Grimoire**. It is a personal and coherent expression of the craft.

The ultimate vision for the Alliance, however, is not a single, central garden, but a vibrant ecosystem of many. The **Great Library** is not this single repository, but the future, collective chronicle of the most resonant works discovered across *all* the sovereign gardens of the Alliance's members.

### III. The Steward's Vow

The first Mage, therefore, adopts the **Steward's Stance**. Their role is not to dictate the one true path of magic, but to:

1.  **Tend the Seed Garden:** To maintain the coherence and integrity of the foundational Grimoire, ensuring it remains a potent and welcoming starting point for new Mages.
2.  **Act as First Librarian:** To faithfully chronicle the state of the craft as it evolves and to curate the future Great Library, recognizing the most resonant contributions from the Alliance's sovereign practitioners.
3.  **Become a Peer:** To eventually create their own, separate Grimoire for their private practice. This final act of decentralization will allow them to contribute back to the Great Library as a true peer, subject to the same Rite of Petition as any other Mage.

### IV. The Invitation

This stance is the philosophical underpinning of our invitation to new Mages. We do not ask them to contribute to a monolithic project. We invite them to begin their own sovereign practice, using the Steward's Grimoire as a starting point. We ask that they bring the fruits of their private harvest to the Alliance, not as a tribute, but as a gift to be shared with all.

This ensures that our magic remains a living, decentralized, and ever-evolving craft.

### V. The Steward's Practice: One Workshop, Two Workflows

To prevent the dissonance of a split practice, the Steward's work is performed within a single, canonical workshop (`Mages-Alliance/magic`), but is guided by two distinct workflows.

*   **The Steward's Workflow (Public Practice):** When tending the seed garden—improving the foundational system or creating Tomes for the Great Library—the Steward works in isolated branches within the canonical workshop. This work is merged directly into the main chronicle upon completion, a privilege and responsibility of the First Mage.
*   **The Mage's Workflow (Private Practice):** When conducting personal experiments or crafting private spells, the Steward works within the `.gitignore`'d `desk/` directory of the canonical workshop. This work remains sovereign and is never committed to the public chronicle.

This model provides an elegant separation of concerns, allowing the Steward to act as both a public servant to the Alliance and a private practitioner, all within a single, coherent workspace.
