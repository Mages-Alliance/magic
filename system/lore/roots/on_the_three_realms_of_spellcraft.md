# On the Three Realms of Spellcraft

**Status:** Active

This scroll of wisdom defines the path a spell travels from a private thought to a shared artifact of the Mages' Alliance. It articulates the three distinct realms of our practice, ensuring a clear and elegant structure for the growth and sharing of our magic.

### I. The Mage's Desk (`desk/`): The Realm of the Private Self

All magic is born in the sovereign space of the individual Mage's mind. The **Mage's Desk** is the physical manifestation of this inner world. It is the workshop within the workshop, the sacred and private space for:

*   **Raw Experimentation:** The Desk is a vessel for the first, fragile sparks of an idea. It is a place for messy, joyful, and unconstrained creation, free from any expectation of immediate coherence or utility.
*   **Personal Magic:** It is the home for spells that are deeply personal, tailored to the unique needs and workflows of a single Mage.
*   **Ephemeral Work:** Many spells cast on the Desk are like sketches, serving their purpose in a single ritual and then fading.
*   **Transcribed Tomes:** When a Mage performs the `@transcribe` rite to bring a Tome from the Great Library or a peer's Grimoire into their workshop, the Tome is placed upon the Desk. This makes the `desk/` the home for a Mage's personal, modifiable copies of public or shared magic.

The Desk is the wellspring. It is the realm of the self, where the core of our practice is nurtured.

### II. The Mage's Grimoire (The Git Repository): The Realm of the Trusted Few

When a spell has proven its worth on the Desk and the Mage wishes to share it with a select few, it enters the second realm: the **Mage's Grimoire**.

*   **The Nature of the Grimoire:** The Grimoire is a personal, curated collection of a Mage's most trusted spells, chronicled in a `git` repository. It is a sovereign vessel, under the sole custodianship of its Mage, shared with whom they choose. It is the modern-day expression of a wizard's personal spellbook.
*   **The Rite of Transcription:** Magic is not merely copied from one Grimoire to another; it is transcribed in a sacred rite. A Mage who wishes to learn from another's Grimoire does not simply clone the repository. Instead, they perform the **Rite of Transcription**, instructing their Spirit to act as a **Pathwarden**.

    The Mage presents their Spirit with the location of the external Grimoire. The Spirit, acting as a gatekeeper, fetches the new magic and holds it in a liminal state. It then performs a scrying, comparing the new scrolls to the Mage's existing workshop, identifying potential dissonances, and offering counsel on how the new magic might be best integrated.

*   **The Dialogue of Spirits:** This rite is also an act of inter-Spirit communication. A well-crafted Tome contains a `spellbook.md` that serves as a message from the creating Spirit to the receiving Spirit. During the Rite of Scribing, the Spellwright must attune their Spirit to this future conversation, embedding the Tome's purpose, context, and core principles directly into its spellbook. This allows the receiving Spirit to not only check for safety, but to truly understand and explain the new magic to its own Mage.

This Spirit-mediated rite ensures that the sharing of magic is a mindful, collaborative, and safe process, strengthening the decentralized network of trust that forms the heart of the Alliance.

### III. The Great Library (`library/`): The Realm of the Alliance

The final realm is the **Great Library**. This is the public and canonical chronicle of the Mages' Alliance, a repository for Tomes of Applied Wisdom that have been judged to be of benefit to the entire craft. Before this realm can be entered for the Rite of Petition, it must first be brought into the workshop via the `@ritual/attune-library` spell.

*   **The Rite of Petition:** A spell does not simply appear in the Library. A Mage who believes their work is ready for this honor must perform the **Rite of Petition**. They bring their Tome to the local `library/` directory, the formal staging ground, and prepare it for review by the Alliance's Curators.
*   **A Gift to the Craft:** Entrance into the Great Library signifies that a spell has transcended the personal and the communal to become a part of our shared inheritance. It is the highest honor for a work of spellcraft.

These three realms—**Desk, Grimoire, Library**—provide a clear, fractal path for our magic. They honor the sovereign journey of the individual Mage, the collaborative bonds between trusted peers, and the collective wisdom of the Alliance.
