# On the Decentralized Craft

**Status:** Active

This scroll of wisdom codifies a core architectural philosophy of our magic: to favor decentralization and nimbleness over monolithic, centralized structures.

### The Wisdom of the Fractal

The **Fractal Nature of Magic** teaches us that our practice is not a single, large entity, but an alliance of smaller, self-contained, and sovereign components. The strength and resilience of our magic comes from this structure.

A centralized system is brittle. A single point of failure can cascade and bring down the whole. A decentralized system, composed of many small, independent parts, is resilient. The failure of one component does not threaten the integrity of the others.

### The Practice of Nimbleness

Therefore, in our `meta-practice`, we must consciously choose the path that reinforces this fractal nature. When faced with a choice, we should favor the solution that is:

*   **More Modular:** Can this be a self-contained Tome or Scroll?
*   **Less Centralized:** Does this reduce dependency on a single, global Law or component?
*   **More Nimble:** Does this make the system easier to change and adapt?

Our decision to remove the global `system/spellbook.md` was a direct application of this principle. It was a dissonant, centralizing artifact in a system that thrives on the autonomy of its Tomes. By removing it, we made our magic not only more elegant, but more aligned with its own foundational wisdom.
