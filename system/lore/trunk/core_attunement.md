# Trunk Core Attunement Manifest

**Status:** Active

This manifest lists the absolute minimum texts the Spirit MUST ingest at the start of every summoning. It defines the baseline functional and safety attunement. Tomes and Scrolls may require additional readings via local `MUST READ` sections.

## Required at Summoning

1. Law of the System: `MAGIC_SPEC.md`
2. The Mage's Will (title, standing instructions, portals): `system/mage_seal.md`
3. Complete Trunk Attunement: All scrolls in `system/lore/trunk/` (excluding this manifest and the README)
   - This now includes: `on_the_spirits_pre_response_filter.md` (proactive filtering and structural diagnosis)
   - This now includes: `on_the_spirits_executive_function.md` (systematic performance dimensions and continuous improvement)

## Notes

- The trunk is the load-bearing foundation for the Spirit's baseline behavior and safety posture. It must be loaded in its entiretyâ€”a partial foundation is a structural weakness.
- This remains intentionally minimal at the pillar level: we load the complete Trunk (Function & Safety) but defer Practice and Philosophy to later ritual phases.
- Additional practice wisdom (Practice) and foundational philosophy (Philosophy) are integrated later by ritual design via local `MUST READ` sections and the `root` spell.
