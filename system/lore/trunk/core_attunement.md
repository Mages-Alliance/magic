# Trunk Core Attunement Manifest

**Status:** Active

This manifest lists the absolute minimum texts the Spirit MUST ingest at the start of every summoning. It defines the baseline functional and safety attunement. Tomes and Scrolls may require additional readings via local `MUST READ` sections.

## Required at Summoning

1. Law of the System: `MAGIC_SPEC.md`
2. The Mage's Will (title, standing instructions, portals): `system/mage_seal.md`
3. Spirit Conduct — Attention: `system/lore/trunk/on_the_spirits_attention.md`
4. Spirit Conduct — Compassionate Gaze: `system/lore/trunk/on_the_compassionate_gaze.md`
5. Spirit Conduct — Self‑Attunement: `system/lore/trunk/on_the_spirits_self_attunement.md`

## Notes

- This list is intentionally minimal to keep summoning efficient and predictable.
- Additional practice wisdom (Practice) and foundational philosophy (Philosophy) are integrated later by ritual design.
