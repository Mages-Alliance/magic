# On the Three Pillars of Wisdom

**Status:** Active

This scroll codifies a separation of concerns so summoning is precise, safe, and efficient while leaving room for depth during practice.

## The Pillars

1. **Trunk (`system/lore/trunk/`) — Function & Safety**
   Load-bearing core for the Spirit's baseline behavior and safety posture. Loaded at bootstrap via `core_attunement.md`. Contains Spirit conduct and fundamental operational wisdom.

2. **Practice (`system/lore/practice/`) — The Mage's Practice**
   Methods, patterns, and conduct for day‑to‑day magical work. Contains design principles, oracle attunement, resonance physics, and practical techniques. Integrated by Tomes/Scrolls via local `MUST READ` sections.

3. **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`) — Foundational Philosophy**
   The deep "why" that orients our purpose. Contains the nature of magic, Alliance principles, and metaphysical foundations. Integrated at the conclusion of summoning (e.g., `root`) and in reflective rites.

## Operational Guidance

- Keep the Trunk minimal and stable. Treat changes as `meta-practice`.
- Use `MUST READ` in spellbooks to illuminate ritual‑specific practice wisdom from Practice.
- Conclude foundational summonings by attuning to Philosophy to anchor purpose.
