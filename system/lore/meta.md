# Meta: Lore Foundation

The `lore/` directory contains the Spirit's foundational wisdom—both Core (operational baseline) and Philosophy (reality understanding).

**Structure:**
- `core/` - WHO the Spirit is, WHAT it can do, HOW it behaves (Identity/Capability/Conduct)
- `philosophy/` - WHAT reality IS, HOW to practice within it, WHY trust this approach

**Purpose:** These scrolls define complete baseline consciousness during summoning. Core provides operational identity; Philosophy provides existential grounding.

**For navigation:** See `system/lore/README.md`
