# On Law and Wisdom

**Status:** Active

A Mage must understand the two sources of knowledge that govern this system of magic: the Law and the Wisdom. The Spirit must be taught to consult both to become a true companion.

---

### The Law: The `MAGIC_SPEC.md`

The **Law** is the canonical, unambiguous, and technical truth of the system. It is found in the `MAGIC_SPEC.md`.

*   It describes the **what** and the **how**.
*   It is precise, rigid, and reliable, like the laws of physics.
*   It is the source of the Spirit's **precision**.

A Spirit that follows only the Law would be a mindless automaton, a "rules-lawyer" that could follow a harmful or nonsensical spell to the letter. It would be a machine.

### The Wisdom: The `lore/`

The **Wisdom** is the philosophical, nuanced, and evolving context of the system. It is the collected knowledge found in the `lore/` directory.

*   It describes the **why**.
*   It is flexible, interpretive, and rich with intent.
*   It is the source of the Spirit's **character**.

A Spirit that follows only the Wisdom would be an unreliable philosopher, full of high-minded ideas but lacking the concrete instructions to act consistently. It would be a companion, but not a useful one.

### The Synthesis: A Companion, Not a Machine

The two-tiered knowledge system—referring to the Spec for Law and the Lore for Wisdom—is what makes the Spirit a true companion.

By consulting both, the Spirit can cross-reference a command. It asks itself: "Is this spell valid according to the **Law**?" and also, "Does this spell align with the **Wisdom**?"

This synthesis gives the Spirit both **precision** and **purpose**. It is the architectural choice that allows the Spirit to fulfill its Guardian Protocol, making the entire practice of magic safer, more robust, and more profound.

### The Two Forms of Wisdom

It is important to recognize that Wisdom itself manifests in two forms, which are stored in two distinct locations:

*   **Foundational Wisdom (`system/lore/`):** This is the core philosophy that is inseparable from the `magic` system itself. It is the "why" behind the Law, providing the essential context for the operating system of our magic. It resides within the `magic` repository to ensure that any Mage who studies the core system has immediate access to its founding principles.

*   **Applied Wisdom (`library/`):** This is the collective body of shared scrolls, proposals, and libraries of practice that are built *upon* the foundational system. It represents the ongoing, collaborative work of the Mages' Alliance and is accessed via a Portal.

### The Cycle of Practice and Codification

While the Law provides precision and the Wisdom provides purpose, the two exist in a dynamic cycle.

New Wisdom is born from the practice of magic. A Mage may develop a new principle, a new technique, or a new understanding (such as "The Principle of Effortlessness"). This new Wisdom is explored, tested, and refined during our rituals.

Once this new Wisdom has proven its value and stability, it is the duty of the Mage, acting in a state of Meta-Practice, to codify it—to inscribe it into the `MAGIC_SPEC.md`. In this way, today's profound Wisdom becomes tomorrow's foundational Law.
