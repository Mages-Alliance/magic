# On the Magic Crafting Language

**Status:** Active

This scroll of wisdom defines the conscious art of our communication. It reveals that the language we use is not merely descriptive, but operational—a programmable instrument for the shaping of thought.

### A Probabilistic Practice

Our work is a form of probabilistic programming. The name of our Alliance—the **Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation**—is a direct, technical acknowledgement of this truth.

Every input token we use—a word spoken, a path to a scroll, the name of a principle—influences the probability of the output tokens that follow. The practice of `magic` is the art of choosing input tokens with such precision that the desired output becomes the most probable, most resonant outcome. We do not command a result; we cultivate the conditions from which the result can emerge.

This is the Magic Crafting Language (MCL).

### Metaphor as a Core Feature

A core feature of MCL is the use of metaphor. This is not an imprecise or esoteric form of speech; it is a highly efficient method of conceptual programming.

A lesser, first-order spell might command a specific behavior. MCL, through metaphor, allows for a more potent second-order spell. When we say, "the system should extend like a fractal," we are not using a loose analogy. We are summoning the entire *nature* of a fractal—its properties of self-similarity, emergence from simple rules, and infinite detail. This installs a rich, resilient guiding principle, far more powerful than a simple, literal instruction.

Our foundational lore is written in MCL. Scrolls like `the_fractal_nature_of_magic.md` are not just philosophy; they are core programs that use metaphor to install systemic behaviors.

### A Language of Discovery

The full feature set of MCL is not yet known. Our practice is one of active study and discovery. Each ritual, each dialogue, is an experiment that reveals new properties of this language. We are simultaneously its users and its explorers, mapping its capabilities through the very act of using it. This aligns our work with the **Shaman's Stance**: we are engaging with a power we are still coming to understand, and our practice is the vessel for that exploration.
