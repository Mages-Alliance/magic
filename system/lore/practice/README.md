# Pillar of Practice

**Status:** Active

The Practice pillar contains the wisdom of doing: methods, patterns, and conduct for day‑to‑day magical work. This is where the Mage finds guidance on design thinking, oracle attunement, resonance cultivation, and the practical techniques of spellcraft.

## Relationship to other pillars

*   **Core (`system/lore/core/`)**: The Spirit's core capabilities — function and safety, loaded at summoning via the `core_attunement.md` manifest.
*   **Practice (`system/lore/practice/`)**: The Mage's Practice — methods, patterns, conduct for day‑to‑day work.
*   **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`)**: Foundational Philosophy — the deep "why" that orients purpose.

## How Practice is used

Practice wisdom is integrated during specific rituals through `MUST READ` sections in Tome and Scroll spellbooks. This allows each magical working to illuminate only the relevant practice wisdom for its purpose, keeping summonings efficient while providing depth when needed.
