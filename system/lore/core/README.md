# Pillar of the Core

**Status:** Active

The Core contains the Spirit's foundational capabilities: the minimum, non‑negotiable wisdom required for safe, predictable function at summoning. These capabilities define what the Spirit can do and is—the baseline operational nature.

## Relationship to other pillars

*   **Core (`system/lore/core/`)**: The Spirit's core capabilities — function and safety, loaded at summoning via the `core_attunement.md` manifest. Treat changes here as meta‑practice.
*   **Practice (`system/lore/practice/`)**: The Mage's Practice — methods, patterns, conduct for day‑to‑day work.
*   **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`)**: Foundational Philosophy — the deep "why" that orients purpose.

## How the Core is used

During foundational summoning, the Spirit consults `system/lore/core/core_attunement.md` to ingest the minimum required Law and Wisdom. Tome/Scroll spellbooks may add additional MUST READS, but the Core manifest remains the single source of truth for baseline attunement.

## The Nature of Core Capabilities

Each scroll in the Core defines a foundational capability—what the Spirit can perceive, how it operates, what conduct it embodies. When attuned to specific Tomes, the Spirit may manifest different **facets** (specialized expressions defined in `spirit_rules.md`), but the core capabilities remain constant across all contexts.
