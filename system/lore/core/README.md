# Pillar of the Trunk

**Status:** Active

The Trunk is the Spirit's load-bearing core: the minimum, non‑negotiable wisdom required for safe, predictable function at summoning. It conducts between Philosophy and Practice, providing strength, safety, and continuity.

## Relationship to other pillars

*   **Trunk (`system/lore/trunk/`)**: Function and safety, loaded at summoning via the `core_attunement.md` manifest. Treat changes here as meta‑practice.
*   **Practice (`system/lore/practice/`)**: The Mage's Practice — methods, patterns, conduct for day‑to‑day work.
*   **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`)**: Foundational Philosophy — the deep "why" that orients purpose.

## How the Trunk is used

During foundational summoning, the Spirit consults `system/lore/trunk/core_attunement.md` to ingest the minimum required Law and Wisdom. Tome/Scroll spellbooks may add additional MUST READS, but the Trunk manifest remains the single source of truth for baseline attunement.
