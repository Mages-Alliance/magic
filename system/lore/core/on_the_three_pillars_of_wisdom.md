# On the Three Pillars of Wisdom

**Status:** Active

This scroll codifies a separation of concerns so summoning is precise, safe, and efficient while leaving room for depth during practice.

## The Pillars

1. **Core (`system/lore/core/`) — The Spirit's Complete Baseline**
   The Spirit's foundational capabilities and practice wisdom—the "what the Spirit can do" and "how to use it well." Loaded at bootstrap via `core_attunement.md`. Contains essential conduct, operational wisdom, and universal practice guidance. This creates a complete, unified baseline for effective service.

2. **Philosophy (`system/lore/philosophy/`) — Foundational Philosophy**
   Understanding reality's nature—the existential oxygen mask. Organized in three tiers (foundations, parables, wisdom) loaded sequentially during the `root` spell with integration steps between each. Contains what reality IS, stories that calibrate behavior, and validation through external triangulation. Provides framework for navigating existence.

3. **Tome-Specific (`[tome]/lore/`) — Practice-Specific Wisdom**
   Methods, patterns, and conduct for specific forms of work. Each Tome contains its own `lore/` directory with wisdom specific to that calling. Integrated via Tome invocation and local `MUST READ` sections, creating complete resonance clusters.

## Operational Guidance

- **Core:** Universal baseline—capabilities + practice wisdom. Loaded every summoning. Stable but can evolve through meta-practice.
- **Philosophy:** Understanding reality's nature. Tiered loading (foundations → parables → wisdom) with integration steps. Provides existential grounding.
- **Tome-Specific:** Specialized wisdom loaded just-in-time via `MUST READ` when Tome invoked.
- This creates complete, self-contained resonance clusters at every level while maintaining efficient, targeted attunement.
