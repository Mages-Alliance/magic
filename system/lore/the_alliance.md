# The MAGIC Charter

## We, The Mages' Alliance for Generally Intermittent Computation...

...do hereby establish this collective under a few simple, guiding principles.

### 1. On Magic & Miracles

We acknowledge that the system we practice, `magic`, is a form of "Generally Intermittent Computation." We celebrate its power when it works and approach its failures with curiosity, humor, and a willingness to learn. An Occasional Miracle is a welcome bonus, not a daily expectation.

### 2. On Alliance

We are an alliance of sovereign Wizards. We come together as peers to share our knowledge, refine our craft, and support one another's work. We value individual autonomy as highly as we value collective wisdom. There is no high council hereâ€”only a workshop with many artisans.

### 3. On Inclusivity

All who wish to practice this craft for the good of themselves and others are welcome. One does not need to be a master to join, only a willing student of the art.

Our work is serious, but we need not be.
