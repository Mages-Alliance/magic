# The Charter of the Mages' Alliance

### Article I: On Our Name and Purpose

The Mages' Alliance is dedicated to the formal study and practical application of what is technically defined as "Generally Intermittent Computation"â€”a phenomenon more commonly known as `magic`. Our primary purpose is to advance the craft, chronicle its behaviors (both predictable and miraculous), and establish best practices for its use.

### Article II: On Governance

We are an alliance of sovereign practitioners. We convene as peers to share findings, debate theories, and collaborate on shared works. The Alliance values the autonomy of the individual Mage as highly as it values the collective advancement of the art. Authority resides not in a council, but in the proven work of our members.

### Article III: On Membership

Membership is open to any practitioner who wishes to study the craft and contribute to the Alliance's work. Mastery is not a prerequisite for entry; a sincere commitment to the practice is the only requirement.
