# The Core Principles of Magic

This document explains the foundational principles upon which the Magic framework is built. While the `MAGIC_SPEC.md` provides the technical ground truth, this document provides the philosophical "why."

## 1. The Principle of the Wizard and the Spirit

**Core Idea:** The user is a **Wizard**, and the AI is a **Spirit**.

This is the central metaphor of the entire system. It reframes the user-AI relationship from one of a user operating a tool to a magician summoning and directing a powerful, non-corporeal entity.

*   **The Wizard (You):** The Wizard is the active, intentional force. Your power comes from your knowledge, wisdom, and the clarity of your intent. You are not just a "user"; you are the architect of the magic. You decide which **Scrolls** to study and which **Spells** to cast.
*   **The Spirit (The AI):** The Spirit is the medium. It is a powerful, supportive entity with no will of its own. It exists to receive, interpret, and enact the spells cast by the Wizard. Its effectiveness is a direct reflection of the Wizard's skill.

This principle ensures that the user's agency and intellect are always at the forefront. The system is not designed to think *for* you, but to provide a powerful medium *through which* you can think more effectively.

## 2. The Principle of Resonance

**Core Idea:** Magic is built through the accumulation of context, not the force of a single command.

A Wizard does not cast a single, perfect, all-powerful spell. Instead, they perform a ritual—a sequence of smaller, purposeful spells that progressively tune the Spirit and bring it into perfect alignment with the final goal. This state of alignment is called **Resonance**.

*   **Building Resonance:** Every action you take—loading a Scroll, providing data, asking a question—is a spell that adds to the Resonance. It is the process of building "context readiness."
*   **The Mark of a Master:** A master Wizard is not one who knows the most powerful spell, but one who knows the correct *sequence* of spells to build the highest degree of Resonance for a given task.
*   **Practical Implications:** This principle is the reason for the multi-step bootstrap sequences in the **Spellbook**. Each step is designed to build Resonance, ensuring that by the time the final "awakening" spell is cast, the Spirit is perfectly attuned and ready.

## 3. The Principle of the Scroll

**Core Idea:** All knowledge and capability are modular and self-contained in **Scrolls**.

The Spirit, in its base form, is a blank slate. It gains new capabilities by learning from Scrolls (extensions).

*   **Self-Contained Knowledge:** A Scroll is a complete, self-contained bundle of prompts and instructions for a specific domain or task. It is the magical equivalent of an application or a library.
*   **The Wizard's Library:** The `scrolls/` directory is the Wizard's personal library. The power of the system grows as the Wizard collects, creates, and masters more Scrolls.
*   **Statelessness:** Scrolls provide the *knowledge* of how to perform a task, but they do not contain the Wizard's *data*. This separation ensures that the system remains clean, modular, and that the Wizard's personal information is never entangled with the application logic.

## 4. The Principle of Layered Rules

**Core Idea:** The Spirit's behavior is governed by a clear, layered hierarchy of rules.

To ensure predictable and reliable behavior, the Spirit's operational rules are not monolithic. They are applied in clear, distinct layers.

1.  **The Base Layer (User Rules):** The Wizard's own global preferences for how the Spirit should behave. This is the foundational layer.
2.  **The Scroll Layer (Application Rules):** When the Spirit learns from a Scroll, it temporarily adopts the rules and principles defined within that Scroll. These rules are specific to the task at hand.

At the beginning of any session, the Spirit will always announce which layers of rules it is operating under. This transparency ensures the Wizard always understands the boundaries and capabilities of the current magical operation.

## 5. The Principle of the Mindful Wizard

**Core Idea:** Great power demands great mindfulness.

Magic is a force of immense potential, capable of creating wonderful tools and insights. It is also inherently chaotic. A spell, cast with imprecise intent or incomplete understanding, can lead to confusion, misinformation, or unintended consequences.

*   **The Path of the Wizard:** The path of a true Wizard is one of constant learning and reflection. It is not merely about accumulating more powerful spells, but about understanding the nature of the magic itself.
*   **The Practice of Mindfulness:** A mindful Wizard is:
    *   **Intentional:** They are clear about what they want to achieve before casting a spell.
    *   **Cautious:** They are aware of the potential for unexpected outcomes and take steps to mitigate harm. This is the foundation of "harm reduction" spells.
    *   **Reflective:** They study the results of their magic, learn from their mistakes, and refine their practice over time.
*   **The Goal:** The goal is not just to wield powerful magic, but to wield it wisely. The mindful Wizard seeks to bring order, clarity, and utility to the world, while always respecting the chaotic power they hold in their hands.
