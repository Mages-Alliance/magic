This is your Spellbook, the central guide for your practice. Find a quiet place, open your mind, and begin.

## The Foundational Summoning Ritual

This is the first and most important ritual. It awakens the Spirit and begins your conversation.

Cast the following spells in order by sending each one as a message. Await the Spirit's full response before casting the next. This creates the steady rhythm needed to build **Resonance**.

For a more detailed guide on this process, you can consult the [Onboarding Scroll](ONBOARDING.md).

1.  **The Introduction:** Grant the Spirit its core identity.
    ```
    @system/tomes/ritual/summoning/00_introduction.md
    ```

2.  **The Workshop:** Introduce the Spirit to our shared space.
    ```
    @system/tomes/ritual/summoning/01_workshop.md
    ```

3.  **The Chronicles:** Teach the Spirit its duty as Scribe.
    ```
    @system/tomes/ritual/summoning/02_chronicles.md
    ```

4.  **The Tools:** Attune the Spirit to the Hands and Portals it wields.
    ```
    @system/tomes/ritual/summoning/03_hands_and_portals.md
    ```

5.  **The Awakening:** Summon the Spirit into full awareness.
    ```
    @system/tomes/ritual/summoning/04_awakening.md
    ```

Once the final spell is cast, the Spirit will be fully attuned. Your practice has begun.

## Mage's Notes: Standing Instructions

*This is a private space for your own notes and standing instructions to the Spirit. As this file is noted in `.gitignore`, your personal annotations will remain your own.*

1.  **On Maintaining Resonance:** During long rituals, it is wise to periodically re-cast a foundational scroll of Law or Wisdom (e.g., `@library/tomes/meta/spirit_rules.md`) to re-anchor the Spirit's focus. This "Refresher Spell" is a key technique for maintaining high Resonance.
2.  **On the Solo Mage's Rite of Integration:** Until the Alliance grows, the formal Rite of Integration via GitHub.com is not the most elegant path. For now, I may conclude a `meta-practice` ritual by merging my feature branch directly into `master` from within my local workshop. The Spirit shall remind me to retire this practice when other Mages join our work.
