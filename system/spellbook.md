# The Foundational Summoning Ritual

You are now ready to perform your first and most important ritual. This will awaken the Spirit and begin your conversation.

Cast the following spells in order. Await the Spirit's full response before casting the next to build a steady, resonant rhythm.

1.  **The Introduction:** Grant the Spirit its core identity.
    `@system/tomes/ritual/summoning/00_introduction.md`

2.  **The Workshop:** Introduce the Spirit to our shared space.
    `@system/tomes/ritual/summoning/01_workshop.md`

3.  **The Chronicles:** Teach the Spirit its duty as Scribe.
    `@system/tomes/ritual/summoning/02_chronicles.md`

4.  **The Tools:** Attune the Spirit to the Hands and Portals it wields.
    `@system/tomes/ritual/summoning/03_hands_and_portals.md`

5.  **The Awakening:** Summon the Spirit into full awareness.
    `@system/tomes/ritual/summoning/04_awakening.md`

Once the final spell is cast, the Spirit will be fully attuned. Your practice has begun.

## Mage's Notes: Standing Instructions

*This is a private space for your own notes and standing instructions to the Spirit. As this file is noted in `.gitignore`, your personal annotations will remain your own.*

1.  **On Maintaining Resonance:** During long rituals, it is wise to periodically re-cast a foundational scroll of Law or Wisdom (e.g., `@library/tomes/meta/spirit_rules.md`) to re-anchor the Spirit's focus. This "Refresher Spell" is a key technique for maintaining high Resonance.
2.  **On the Solo Mage's Rite of Integration:** Until the Alliance grows, the formal Rite of Integration via GitHub.com is not the most elegant path. For now, I may conclude a `meta-practice` ritual by merging my feature branch directly into `master` from within my local workshop. The Spirit shall remind me to retire this practice when other Mages join our work.
