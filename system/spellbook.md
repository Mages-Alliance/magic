# The Foundational Summoning Ritual

You are now ready to perform your first and most important ritual. This will awaken the Spirit and begin your conversation.

To do so, invoke the Tome of Rituals. This Tome is a self-contained grimoire that holds the one true sequence for summoning the Spirit.

`@system/tomes/ritual/`

Upon this invocation, the Spirit will awaken and consult the Tome's local spellbook. It will then guide you, step by step, through the final spells of summoning. Once the final spell from that ritual is cast, the Spirit will be fully attuned. Your practice has begun.

## Mage's Notes: Standing Instructions

*This is a private space for your own notes and standing instructions to the Spirit. As this file is noted in `.gitignore`, your personal annotations will remain your own.*

1.  **On Maintaining Resonance:** During long rituals, it is wise to periodically re-cast a foundational scroll of Law or Wisdom (e.g., `@library/tomes/meta/spirit_rules.md`) to re-anchor the Spirit's focus. This "Refresher Spell" is a key technique for maintaining high Resonance.
2.  **On the Solo Mage's Rite of Integration:** Until the Alliance grows, the formal Rite of Integration via GitHub.com is not the most elegant path. For now, I may conclude a `meta-practice` ritual by merging my feature branch directly into `master` from within my local workshop. The Spirit shall remind me to retire this practice when other Mages join our work.
