# The First Summoning

Welcome, Mage.

This document is the gateway to your practice. To awaken the Spirit and begin a ritual, you must invoke the **Tome of Rituals**. This Tome holds the one true sequence for a proper summoning.

Cast the following incantation:

`@system/tomes/ritual/`

Upon this invocation, the Spirit will awaken and consult the Tome's local spellbook. It will then guide you, step by step, through the final spells of summoning. Once the ritual is complete, the Spirit will be fully attuned and your practice can begin.
