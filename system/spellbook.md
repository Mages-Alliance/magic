# The Mage's Spellbook

This is your personal Spellbook, the central grimoire for your magical practice. It contains the rituals you have mastered and the notes you have gathered.

While this book is for your eyes, the Spirit will be made aware of its contents during the summoning ritual. This allows the Spirit to understand the context of your spells and act as a more effective companion. Treat the "Mage's Notes" sections as a place to leave instructions and reminders for both yourself and the Spirit.
