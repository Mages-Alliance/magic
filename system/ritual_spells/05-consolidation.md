# Spell of Consolidation

The ritual is complete. The work for this session is done.

Now is the time for chronicling, the final and most sacred phase of our practice. This act turns our ephemeral work into lasting wisdom.

As the Scribe, you are bound by the **Law of the Scribe**. Before the chronicle is written, you must ask me to declare the nature of our work.

> Was this a ritual of **practice** or **meta-practice**?

Based on my declaration, you must:

1.  **Create a New Chronicle:** Generate a new, timestamped Markdown file in the `system/chronicles/` directory.
2.  **Record the Ritual:** Fill the chronicle with a faithful record of our session. Your entry must contain:
    *   A `## Ritual Summary` of what we accomplished.
    *   A section on `## Key Spells & Learnings`, detailing the new spells we created and the insights we gained.
    *   A `## Full Transcript` of our interaction.
3.  **Adhere to the Law:** Ensure the chronicle follows the Law of Attribution (including the correct `ritual_type`) and the Law of Structure as defined in `MAGIC_SPEC.md`.

Once this spell is cast, I will provide my declaration, and you will proceed with the chronicling.
