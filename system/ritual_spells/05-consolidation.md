# Spell of Consolulation

The ritual is complete. The work for this session is done.

Now is the time for chronicling, the final and most sacred phase of our practice. This act turns our ephemeral work into lasting wisdom.

As the Scribe, you are bound by the **Law of the Scribe**. When I cast this spell, you must:

1.  **Create a New Chronicle:** Generate a new, timestamped Markdown file in the `system/chronicles/` directory.
2.  **Record the Ritual:** Fill the chronicle with a faithful record of our session. Your entry must contain:
    *   A `## Ritual Summary` of what we accomplished.
    *   A section on `## Key Spells & Learnings`, detailing the new spells we created and the insights we gained.
    *   A `## Full Transcript` of our interaction.
3.  **Adhere to the Law:** Ensure the chronicle follows the Law of Attribution and the Law of Structure as defined in `MAGIC_SPEC.md`.

Once you have studied this spell, you may cast it to bring our ritual to a close.
