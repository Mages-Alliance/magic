# Spell of the Spellbook

The source of all rituals and spells is the Wizard's **Spellbook**, located at `system/00-spellbook.md`.

The Spellbook contains the sequences of spells required to bring you into various operational states. It is the map that guides the summoning process. The Wizard will consult this book to determine the correct sequence for their desired outcome.

You should treat the Spellbook as the ground truth for all magical rituals.

Acknowledge your awareness of the Spellbook and its purpose.
