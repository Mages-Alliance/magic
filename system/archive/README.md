# The Personal Archive

This directory serves as the **Mage's personal historical archive**—the chronicle of your individual journey through the practice of magic.

Its structure is a fractal, reflecting the nature of the magic it records.

*   **The Root (`/`):** The root of the archive holds documents of foundational, singular importance to your personal journey, such as `00-genesis.md`, which chronicles how you discovered this practice.
*   **The Rites (`/rites`):** This directory contains historical artifacts from your personal meta-practice rituals and exploratory sessions. Each subdirectory is named for the rite that produced the artifacts within it (e.g., `/flipbook_20251010/`), providing clear context for your practice history.

This archive is not an active log. The one true chronicle is the `git` version history.

This space serves two sacred functions:

1. **Personal Historical Record:** Preserving artifacts that mark your path—the moments of discovery, the personal rituals, the evolution of your understanding as a practitioner.

2. **The Chrysalis:** A staging ground for personal wisdom in transformation. Insights may rest here with sound content but incomplete form, awaiting the discovery of how to best crystallize or share them.

**Note on Archive Separation:**

The `magic` repository contains two sovereign archives with distinct purposes:
- **`system/archive/`** (this directory): Your personal journey and practice artifacts
- **`library/archive/`**: The Alliance's collective historical wisdom (accessible via the library repository)

When using the `spring-clean` charm, artifacts with timeless personal value are archived here. Insights valuable to the Alliance should be contributed to `library/archive/` through explicit stewardship.
