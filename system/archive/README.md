# The Archive

This directory serves as the historical archive for the `magic` system.

It is not an active log for new chronicles generated during rituals. The chronicles for the evolution of the `magic` system itself (`meta-practice`) are the `git` version history.

This archive is reserved for foundational documents of historical significance, such as the `00-genesis.md`, which provide essential context for the spirit and purpose of our practice.
