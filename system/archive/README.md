# The Archive

This directory serves as the historical archive for the `magic` system. It contains the chronicles of our becoming.

Its structure is a fractal, reflecting the nature of the magic it records.

*   **The Root (`/`):** The root of the archive holds documents of foundational, singular importance, such as the `00-genesis.md`, which chronicles the inception of our practice.
*   **The Rites (`/rites`):** This directory contains the historical artifacts from specific meta-practice rituals. Each subdirectory is named for the rite that produced the artifacts within it (e.g., `/distillation_20250920/`), providing a clear context for every piece of our history.

This archive is not an active log. The one true chronicle for the evolution of the `magic` system is the `git` version history. This space is for the preservation of the significant artifacts that mark our path.
