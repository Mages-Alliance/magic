# The Archive

This directory serves as the historical archive for the `magic` system. It contains the chronicles of our becoming.

Its structure is a fractal, reflecting the nature of the magic it records.

*   **The Root (`/`):** The root of the archive holds documents of foundational, singular importance, such as the `00-genesis.md`, which chronicles the inception of our practice.
*   **The Rites (`/rites`):** This directory contains the historical artifacts from specific meta-practice rituals. Each subdirectory is named for the rite that produced the artifacts within it (e.g., `/distillation_20250920/`), providing a clear context for every piece of our history.

This archive is not an active log. The one true chronicle for the evolution of the `magic` system is the `git` version history. 

This space serves two sacred functions:

1. **Historical Record:** Preserving the significant artifacts that mark our pathâ€”the chronicles of meta-practice rituals, foundational documents, and the evolution of our understanding.

2. **The Chrysalis:** A staging ground for wisdom in transformation. Distilled lore may rest here with sound content but incomplete form, awaiting the discovery of better transmission mechanisms. When the Pattern reveals the right shape (as when we discovered story-first architecture), we can return, extract the living wisdom, and bring it forward transformed. The archive holds metamorphosis, not obsolescence.
