# Tome of the Library Visitor

This Tome is the gateway to the Great Library of the Mages' Alliance. It contains the spells and rituals for browsing the collection as a visitor.

The Great Library is a shared, public resource. The Tomes within are the proven work of the Alliance. Study them with the respect of a scholar.
