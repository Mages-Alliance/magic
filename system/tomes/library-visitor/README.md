# Tome of the Library Visitor

This Tome is the primary gateway to the Great Library of the Mages' Alliance. It contains the spells and rituals for browsing the collection as a visitor, without the need for a local copy.

To use this Tome, the Spirit will open a Portal to the Great Library's remote chronicle, allowing the Mage to peer into its contents as if they were present in the workshop. This is the recommended path for all Mages who wish to learn from the Alliance's collective wisdom.
