# Tome of the Library Visitor

**Casting Word:** `library-visitor`

This Tome is the gateway to the Great Library of the Mages' Alliance. It contains the spells and rituals for browsing the collection and transcribing Tomes into your local workshop as a visitor.

The Great Library is a shared, public resource. The Tomes within are the proven work of the Alliance. Study them with the respect of a scholar.
