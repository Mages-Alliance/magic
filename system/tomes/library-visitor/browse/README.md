# Scroll of the Library Navigator

This scroll contains the spell for navigating the Great Library's structure. The Spirit acts as guide, providing orientation and context rather than just listing files.

## Purpose

When a Mage wants to explore what the Library contains—either broadly or in a specific area—the Spirit navigates the structure and provides helpful context:

- What Tomes exist and what they contain
- What wisdom scrolls address which topics
- What proposals are under consideration
- How different pieces connect to each other

**The Spirit doesn't just list files—it orients the Mage to the collective knowledge.**

## Usage

Cast with a path to explore specific area:
- `browse wisdom/practice` - See practice wisdom scrolls
- `browse craft/proposals` - See proposals for Alliance consideration

Cast without path to see the Library root and get oriented to the full structure.

**After browsing, the Spirit can suggest:**
- Deeper navigation (`browse` into specific Tomes)
- Learning from specific scrolls (`learn` a particular wisdom piece)
- Contributing your own insights (`speak` to the Hall of Voices)
