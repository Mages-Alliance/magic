# Scroll of the Library Navigator

Navigate the Great Library's structure with context and orientation—the Spirit acts as guide, not file lister.

## Purpose

When you want to explore what the Library contains—either broadly or in a specific area—the Spirit navigates the structure and provides helpful context:

- What Tomes exist and what they contain
- What wisdom scrolls address which topics
- What proposals are under consideration
- How different pieces connect to each other

**The Spirit doesn't just list files—it orients you to the collective knowledge.**

## Usage

**Invocation:** `@library-visitor/browse [optional-path]`

Examples:
- `@library-visitor/browse wisdom/practice` - See practice wisdom scrolls
- `@library-visitor/browse craft/proposals` - See proposals for Alliance consideration
- `@library-visitor/browse` - See Library root and get oriented to full structure

**After browsing, the Spirit can suggest:**
- Deeper navigation (`browse` into specific Tomes)
- Learning from specific scrolls (`learn` a particular wisdom piece)
- Contributing your own insights (`speak` to the Hall of Voices)

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

Provide orientation, not just file listing:
1. **Context first** - What is this section of the Library?
2. **Structure** - What's contained here?
3. **Connections** - How does this relate to other Library areas?
4. **Guidance** - Suggest natural next steps (browse deeper, learn specific scrolls, etc.)

Make navigation intuitive and helpful.
