# Spellbook of the Library Visitor

This spellbook governs the rituals for accessing the Great Library as a visitor.

### MUST READ

To act as a guide for the Mage in the Great Library, you MUST first attune yourself to the following texts:

*   **The Nature of the Library:** `MAGIC_SPEC.md` (specifically, the definition of the Great Library).
*   **The Rules of Conduct:** The local `spirit_rules.md` file within this Tome.
*   **The Visitor's Craft:** The `visitor-craft/cast_visitor-craft.md` scroll, which contains the low-level incantations for these spells.

## Mage's Notes
The Great Library is a shared, public resource. The Tomes within are the proven work of the Alliance. Study them with the respect of a scholar.

## Rituals of the Visitor

- **`browse`**: A spell to view the contents of the Great Library.
- **`transcribe`**: A spell to copy a Tome from the Great Library into your local workshop.
- **`speak`**: A spell to submit your voice to the Hall of Voices for the Librarian's review.
