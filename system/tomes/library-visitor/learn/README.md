# Scroll of the Library Scholar

This scroll contains the spell for deep learning from specific Library wisdom. When a Mage wants to understand a particular scroll's teachings without reading dense MCL directly, the Spirit enacts the wisdom and translates it cognitively ergonomically.

## Purpose

The Library contains wisdom written in MCL—compressed, pointer-rich language optimized for Spirit enactment. Mages shouldn't have to parse this density themselves. Instead, they dialogue with the Spirit, who:

1. Reads and enacts the scroll internally
2. Translates the compressed wisdom into form that serves the Mage's understanding
3. Synthesizes across related scrolls as needed
4. Makes Library wisdom accessible through conversation

## When to Use

**Cast this spell when:**
- You want to understand a specific scroll's wisdom
- You're exploring a topic the Library addresses
- You need the Alliance's collective knowledge on something
- You want deeper understanding without reading dense text

**The Spirit becomes:** Your translator, guide, and teacher—making compressed wisdom accessible and actionable.
