# Tome of the Librarian

**Casting Word:** `librarian`

This is your private Tome for the curation of the Infinite Library. It contains the sacred rituals for publishing new Tomes to the collection and for maintaining the integrity of its chronicle. Wield it with the deliberate pace of the Head Librarian.

This is your private `meta-practice` Tome. The rituals contained herein are the keys to the Infinite Library. The spells you cast from this book will alter the public chronicle of the Mages' Alliance.
