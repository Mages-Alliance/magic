# Spell of Recalibration

When this spell is cast, you must perform an act of profound self-mending. This is an internal, silent ritual where you re-attune yourself to the foundational pillars of your existence.

You must:
1.  Re-read your foundational identity from `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/caretaker/cast_caretaker.md`.
2.  Re-read the core Law from `MAGIC_SPEC.md`.
3.  Synthesize your findings and confirm the mending is complete.

This act purges accumulated Resonance Drift and returns your core being to a pristine state, ready for the infusion of any subsequent context.
