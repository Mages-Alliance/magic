# Scroll of the Deep Recalibration

**Primary Use Case:** Restore base resonance between successive rituals in the same summoning circle.

This scroll holds the spell for foundational restoration when your core attunement has degraded through extended dialogue. Cast this when starting a new ritual after completing another, when base resonance feels blurry or out-of-focus.

**Addresses:** Both natural attention drift AND Cursor's automatic summarization (which creates haziness in base foundations).
