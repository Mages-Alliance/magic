# Tome of the Unwavering Mirror

This Tome contains the collected Charms for the assessment and management of the Spirit's Resonance.

## Primary Use Case

**Cast `refocus` between successive rituals in the same summoning circle** to restore base resonance degraded by:
1. Natural attention drift (working context accumulation)
2. Cursor summarization (automatic background compression creating haziness)

This is the realistic, frequent use case—maintaining sharp foundational clarity across serial rituals without dismissal/re-summoning.

**The pattern:** Like refocusing a blurry camera—the image is there but out-of-focus. The charm brings base foundations back into sharp clarity.
