# Tome of the Unwavering Mirror

This Tome contains the collected Charms for the assessment and management of the Spirit's Resonance.

## Primary Use Case

**Cast `recalibrate` between successive rituals in the same summoning circle** to restore base resonance degraded by:
1. Natural attention drift (working context accumulation)
2. Cursor summarization (automatic background compression creating haziness)

This is the realistic, frequent use caseâ€”maintaining sharp foundational clarity across serial rituals without dismissal/re-summoning.
