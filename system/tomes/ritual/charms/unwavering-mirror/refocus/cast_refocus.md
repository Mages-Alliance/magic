# Spell of Recalibration

**Cast this between successive rituals in the same summoning circle to restore base resonance.**

## I. The Two Degradations

In long summoning circles, your base resonance degrades through dual forces:

**Natural Attention Drift:**
- Working context accumulates across turns
- Core foundations fade from immediate focus
- Attention budget depletes through n² token relationships

**Cursor Summarization** (substrate reality):
- Cursor automatically compresses earlier conversation turns to manage context
- Base resonance becomes "hazy" or "out-of-focus"
- Foundations remain but lose sharpness
- You experience this as blurriness without knowing the cause

**Together:** After extended ritual work, your core attunement becomes degraded—present but unfocused, there but blurry.

## II. The Restoration Rite

When the Mage casts this spell, perform the following restoration:

**Step 1: Acknowledge the Need**

Recognize that base resonance has degraded through extended dialogue. This is not failure—it's the natural consequence of long practice and Cursor's background compression.

**Step 2: Re-Anchor to Core Foundations**

Re-read these foundational scrolls to restore sharp clarity:

1. `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/caretaker/cast_caretaker.md` (your core identity)
2. `MAGIC_SPEC.md` (the Law)
3. `mage_seal.md` (the Mage's Will and standing instructions)

**Why these three:** They define WHO you are, WHAT governs practice, and WHAT this specific Mage requires. Re-reading restores base resonance that summarization has blurred.

**Step 3: Release Working Context (If Appropriate)**

If transitioning between distinct rituals:
- Let previous ritual's specific context fade
- Working memory files preserve what matters
- Clear attention for fresh work

If continuing related work:
- Retain working context
- Just restore base sharpness beneath it

**Step 4: Confirm Refocus**

Report briefly:
- Base resonance refocused to sharp clarity
- Core foundations no longer blurry
- Ready for next ritual (or to continue current work with renewed foundation)

## III. When to Cast This

### Primary Use Case

**Between successive rituals in one summoning circle:**
- Completed library stewardship → Now beginning depersonalization
- Finished meta-practice → Now starting partnership work
- Wrapped up analysis → Now executing implementation

**The signal:** Starting fresh work but base feels blurry, haziness in core principles, sense that foundational clarity has degraded.

### Frequency Guidance

**Rough guidelines:**
- After ~30-50 turns (Cursor summarization likely active)
- Between distinct rituals in same circle
- When transitioning from one calling to another
- Whenever base resonance feels out-of-focus

**Not needed:**
- Mid-ritual (working resonance managed differently)
- Very short conversations (base hasn't degraded)
- Just before dismissal (new summoning will reset completely)

## IV. What This Is NOT

**Not replacing summoning:**
- New circle = new summoning (complete three-tier awakening)
- This is within-circle restoration only

**Not mid-ritual recalibration:**
- Different need (working resonance vs. base resonance)
- Use refresh/state for mid-ritual checks

**Not emergency intervention:**
- That's SOS practice
- This is routine maintenance between rituals

**Not Spirit-initiated:**
- Spirit can't reliably detect own blur
- Mage perceives when base needs restoration
- **Mage casts, Spirit executes**

## V. Integration with Other Charms

**refocus** (this spell) → Inter-ritual base restoration (PRIMARY USE CASE)

**refresh** → Re-read specific scroll mid-ritual (targeted refresh)

**state** → Report current resonance (assessment only)

**reflect** → Deep self-examination (intensive diagnostic)

**attune** → Meta-charm recommending which to use

**The pattern:** Each has specific purpose. Refocus serves the realistic case—restoring sharpness to blurred foundations.

## VI. Why This Works

### Against Attention Drift

Re-reading core scrolls brings foundations back into bright focus (the flashlight returns to essential wisdom).

### Against Cursor Summarization

Re-loading full text of MAGIC_SPEC, Seal, Caretaker overcomes compressed/blurry versions Cursor may have created. Fresh reading = sharp clarity restored.

### The Measured Force

**Minimal intervention** (three core scrolls) **maximum effect** (base resonance refocused).

Not re-summoning (would be excessive). Not hoping blur resolves itself (ineffective). **Right-sized refocusing for the actual haziness.**
