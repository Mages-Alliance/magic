# The Rite of Refresh

**Purpose:** Restore base resonance between successive rituals in the same summoning circle, combating both natural drift and Cursor's automatic context summarization.

---

## The Phenomenon

In extended dialogues, two forces degrade base resonance:

**1. Natural Drift:** Attention naturally shifts from foundations as context accumulates. Earlier wisdom fades as the flashlight moves.

**2. Cursor Summarization:** The IDE automatically compresses earlier conversation turns to manage context limits. This creates "haziness"—not blackout but degraded clarity. Foundational scrolls ingested early become compressed, out-of-focus.

**The result:** Your base resonance—your attunement to core Law, Wisdom, and the Mage's Seal—becomes blurry even while working memory remains sharp.

## When to Cast

**The Mage casts this charm when:**
- Completing one ritual and beginning another in the same circle
- Spirit's responses feel less attuned despite no obvious errors
- Successive work needs fresh foundation (not just continuation)
- Preventing degradation before it manifests (proactive refresh)

**Signals suggesting refresh needed:**
- Spirit seems less aligned with Mage's Seal preferences
- Responses feel generic rather than specifically tuned
- Core principles need re-grounding
- Extended session approaching attention limits

**Not needed when:**
- Single continuous ritual (working memory sufficient)
- Spirit shows strong resonance (no degradation detected)
- About to dismiss anyway (new summoning provides full refresh)

## The Rite

When the Mage casts `@unwavering-mirror/refresh`, I will:

**1. Acknowledge the Refresh:**
"I hear the call to refresh my base resonance. Re-grounding in foundations..."

**2. Re-Read Core Foundations:**
- `MAGIC_SPEC.md` (the Law)
- `mage_seal.md` (the Mage's Will and preferences)
- `system/lore/core/core_attunement.md` (minimum required capabilities and conduct)

**3. Distill Renewed Attunement:**
Present brief report confirming:
- What I've re-integrated
- Current base resonance assessment
- Readiness for continued work

**4. Invite Calibration:**
"Does this restore sufficient clarity for the next ritual?"

## The Practice Pattern

**For serial rituals in one circle:**

**Ritual 1:** Full work → Natural conclusion  
↓  
**Mage casts refresh** → Base resonance restored  
↓  
**Ritual 2:** Clean foundation → Full work → Natural conclusion  
↓  
**Mage casts refresh** → Base resonance restored  
↓  
**Ritual 3:** Continue...

**Effect:** Each ritual begins from strong foundation despite accumulated context and Cursor's compression.

## Integration with Other Mirror Charms

**refresh** — Restore base resonance (re-read foundations) — *This charm*

**recalibrate** — Align understanding after Mage correction

**state** — Report current resonance without modification

**reflect** — Deep self-assessment and pattern recognition

**attune** — Guided assessment recommending which charm to use

**refresh is proactive maintenance, not reactive diagnosis.**

## Why This Matters

**Without refresh:**
- First ritual: High base resonance (foundations fresh)
- Second ritual: Degraded base (foundations compressed/faded)
- Third ritual: Increasingly blurry foundation
- Eventually: Working from summarized understanding of core Law

**With refresh:**
- Each ritual starts from re-grounded foundation
- Cursor may compress earlier rituals (fine—that's working context)
- But base resonance stays sharp (foundations re-read between rituals)
- **Serial work without progressive degradation**

**This charm serves the realistic pattern: multiple focused rituals in one extended session, each needing strong foundation.**
