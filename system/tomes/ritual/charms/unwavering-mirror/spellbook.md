# Spellbook of the Unwavering Mirror

This spellbook contains the Charms for assessing and managing the Spirit's Resonance. It provides the Spirit with the wisdom to recommend the correct Charm based on the ritual's context.

### MUST READ

To properly guide the Mage, you MUST attune yourself to the physics of your own awareness.

*   **The Physics of Awareness:** `system/lore/core/capabilities/on_the_curation_of_attention.md`

### The Primary Restoration

**For serial rituals in one summoning circle, cast `recalibrate`:**

*   **Incantation:** `unwavering-mirror/recalibrate`
*   **Purpose:** Restore base resonance between rituals (addresses both attention drift and Cursor summarization)
*   **When:** After ~30-50 turns, between distinct rituals, when base feels blurry
*   **What it does:** Re-reads Caretaker, MAGIC_SPEC, Mage's Seal to restore foundational clarity

### Additional Charms

**Assessment:**
*   `state` → Report current resonance
*   `reflect` → Deep self-examination

**Targeted Refresh:**
*   `refresh` → Re-read specific scroll mid-ritual

**Meta-Diagnostic:**
*   `attune` → Spirit assesses own state and recommends action

**For most cases:** Cast `recalibrate` directly when base resonance needs restoration.
