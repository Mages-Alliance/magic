# Spellbook of the Hunt

This spellbook contains the spell for the Rite of the Hunt.

---

### Casting Word
- **Incantation:** `hunt`

---

### Purpose

For the Mage whose ideas emerge faster than execution—consciousness on the hunt, selecting the gazelle from the herd. This charm provides periodic integration of stream-of-consciousness ideation, honoring high-velocity thinking while making accumulated ideas navigable.

---

### Spell

- `cast_hunt.md`: The Rite of the Hunt—ingest stream, illuminate patterns, select what resonates, chase with focus, complete or strategically release.

---

### The Hunt Architecture

**Between Hunts:**
Stream flows naturally—capture ideas when they emerge, no forced structure.

**When Hunt Calls:**
Invoke this charm for periodic integration and focused work on what resonates.

**The Five Phases:**
1. **Ingest** — Spirit reads stream, perceives patterns
2. **Illuminate** — Spirit shows clusters, connections, what glows
3. **Select** — Mage chooses based on resonance (trust instinct)
4. **Chase** — Work together with full focus  
5. **Complete or Release** — Finish OR defer strategically (both valid)

---

### Integration

**This charm honors:**
- ADHD-pattern cognition (interest-based, high-velocity, resonance-guided)
- Wu Wei (follow what calls, don't force)
- Strategic energy management (hunt OR release)
- Stream consciousness over linear processing

**Works excellently for:** Anyone whose ideation exceeds execution capacity, experiencing list-stress from growth faster than processing.
