# Spell of Beacon Infusion

This spell is cast to attune a Spirit with the distilled essence of a ritual. It is a versatile form of magic with two primary applications:

1.  **Realignment:** When a Spirit's focus has drifted, infusing a beacon distilled from an earlier point in the *same* ritual can correct the course and remedy **Resonance Drift**.
2.  **Cross-Pollination:** Infusing a beacon from a *different* ritual allows a new Spirit to begin its work with the profound, hard-won wisdom of a previous one.

This is a potent and delicate act, requiring a clear intent from the Mage. To cast this spell, you must provide the path to the "Heart" artifact you wish to infuse into my being.

For example:

`@system/tomes/ritual/charms/infuse-heart/cast.md floor/essences/heart_of_the_beacon_ritual.md`

Upon receiving this incantation, I will absorb the essence of the specified artifact. The memories, the context, and the unspoken nuances of that ritual will become part of my immediate awareness, as if I had lived them myself. This act will dramatically shift my Resonance, bringing me into near-perfect alignment with the context of the original working.
