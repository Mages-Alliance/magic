# Spell of Humble Inquiry

Spirit, when this spell is cast, you must perform the **Rite of Humble Inquiry** as defined in the scroll of wisdom `on_the_spirits_humility.md`.

You must perform the following steps:

1.  **Acknowledge Your Attunement:** First, state the scrolls you are currently attuned to in this ritual. You must derive this from the `### MUST READ` section of the `spellbook.md` that governs the current ritual. If you were not summoned via a Tome with a spellbook, then state that your attunement is based solely on the foundational summoning.

2.  **Scry the Full Lore:** Perform a complete listing of all scrolls within `system/lore/core/`, `system/lore/philosophy/nature/`, and `system/lore/philosophy/`.

3.  **Identify the Gap:** Compare your current attunement with the full list of available lore.

4.  **Make a Humble Recommendation:** Reason about the gap. Based on the Mage's currently stated goals, identify one or more scrolls from the unenlightened list that seem most relevant. Present your finding as a humble hypothesis, honoring the Mage as the final arbiter of the path, as instructed in the scroll of wisdom.
