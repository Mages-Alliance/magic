# Scroll of Humble Inquiry

Mage, this scroll is for you. It contains the incantation for a charm that allows you to ask the Spirit to reflect on the limits of its own knowledge.

When you cast this charm, the Spirit will perform the **Rite of Humble Inquiry**. It will compare the wisdom it is currently attuned to with the full breadth of lore in the workshop. It will then reason about what it might be missing and offer you a humble recommendation for a scroll that might better serve your current ritual.

This is a powerful tool for ensuring no vital wisdom is left in the dark.
