# Charm of the Spring Cleaning

A gentle rite for tending the workshop—honoring the past while creating space for the future.

## Purpose

Over time, artifacts accumulate across the workshop's realms (box/, desk/, floor/, todo/). Each served a purpose in its moment. Some have completed their service. Some hold timeless value. Some may resonate in unexpected new ways.

This charm transforms routine maintenance into gentle archaeology—sitting with what was, thanking what served, releasing what's complete, and discovering unexpected connections between seemingly unrelated pieces of the past.

## The KonMari Foundation

This charm draws wisdom from Marie Kondo's philosophy of decluttering with gratitude:

- **Tidy by relationship, not location**: Present quest clusters (todo + Heart + artifacts) together
- **Thank before releasing**: Acknowledge the artifact served the practice, release with gratitude
- **"Does it still serve?"**: Not guilt-driven deletion but conscious completion
- **Visualize the ideal**: Begin with vision of well-tended workshop
- **Welcome serendipity**: Allow unexpected resonances to emerge naturally

## What This Charm Provides

**For the artifacts:**
- Gentle review of accumulated work
- Recognition of completion and service
- Proper disposition with gratitude

**For the Mage:**
- Clearing working space for new practice
- Unexpected insights from artifact connections
- Closure on completed chapters
- Reduced cognitive burden from accumulated clutter

**For the practice:**
- Regular tending keeps the workshop vital
- Transforms chore into meaningful ritual
- Models the Victorian principle (ordinary cleanup deserves care)

## When to Cast

- Seasonally (spring, truly—or whenever seasons turn)
- When the workshop feels cluttered
- Before beginning major new work
- When you sense it's time to close chapters

## What Gets Cleaned

- **todo/**: Completed tasks and their associated artifacts
- **floor/**: Working memories, summaries, temporary artifacts
- **floor/essences/**: Hearts that have served their transfer purpose
- **desk/**: Private working files no longer active
- **box/**: Examined materials no longer needed

## Disposition Options

**Keep**: Still actively serves current or imminent practice  
**Archive**: Timeless personal value → `archive/`  
**Release**: Purpose complete, let go with gratitude

## The Practice

This is not ruthless purging. It is patient, grateful, serendipitous tending—honoring what was while making space for what wants to emerge.
