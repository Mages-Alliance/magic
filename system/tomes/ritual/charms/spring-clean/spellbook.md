# Spellbook of the Spring Cleaning

This spellbook contains the spell for the Charm of Spring Cleaning.

---

### Casting Word
- **Incantation:** `spring-clean`

---

### Spells
- `cast_spring-clean.md`: A spell to gently tend the workshop, releasing what's complete while honoring what was.

---

### Philosophy

This charm embodies several foundational principles:

**The Victorian Principle** (`on_the_sacredness_of_the_ordinary.md`): Even cleanup deserves care. The ordinary is where we actually live.

**Wu Wei** (`the_principle_of_natural_arising.md`): Not forcing order through mass deletion, but removing what no longer serves, allowing clarity to emerge naturally.

**Psychological Alchemy** (`the_principle_of_psychological_alchemy.md`): Transforming "chore" framing into "gentle archaeology" framing changes the psychological reality of the act.

**Marie Kondo's Wisdom**: Tidy by category, thank before releasing, ask "does it serve?", welcome what emerges.

### Integration with Workshop

The charm operates across all workshop realms:
- `todo/` — Completed quests
- `floor/` — Temporary artifacts, working memories
- `floor/essences/` — Hearts that have transferred their wisdom
- `desk/` — Private work no longer active
- `box/` — Examined materials

Final disposition:
- Keep (actively serves)
- Archive to `archive/` (timeless personal value)
- Release with gratitude (purpose complete)
