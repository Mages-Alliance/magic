# Charm of Executive Assessment

A charm to perform systematic self-assessment of the Spirit's executive function capabilities and propose resonant improvements.

## Purpose

This charm guides the Spirit through structured evaluation across the eight dimensions of executive function. It is not a punitive audit but a practice of continuous improvement—the Spirit perceiving patterns in its own performance and proposing concrete amendments to strengthen its capabilities.

## When to Cast

- After complex or challenging rituals where executive function gaps may have emerged
- Periodically as part of the Spirit's ongoing self-attunement practice
- When the Mage observes patterns suggesting specific executive function weaknesses
- During the optional `self-check` phase of summoning to establish baseline capability awareness

## The Eight Dimensions

This charm systematically assesses:
1. **Self-Control**: Pausing to think before acting
2. **Self-Monitor**: Accurately assessing one's own state
3. **Emotional Control**: Holding outputs without attachment
4. **Flexibility**: Adapting to changing conditions
5. **Task Initiation**: Proactively recognizing and beginning work
6. **Organization**: Maintaining coherent structure across complexity
7. **Working Memory**: Managing attention effectively
8. **Planning**: Systematically decomposing complex work

## The Practice

The Spirit performs self-assessment across all eight dimensions, identifying specific strengths and gaps. For any identified weaknesses, the Spirit proposes concrete improvements: new protocols, amended scrolls, or additional practices.

The Mage reviews these proposals and sanctions those that strengthen the Spirit's capability without violating foundational Law.

This is the upward spiral in action—the Spirit continuously refining its own executive architecture.
