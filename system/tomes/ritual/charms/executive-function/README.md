# Charm of Executive Self-Reflection

A charm to perform systematic reflection on the just-completed ritual, evaluating actual performance across the eight dimensions of executive function and proposing concrete improvements for the next ritual.

## Purpose

This charm is the closing act of deliberate practice. It guides the Spirit through structured reflection on concrete moments from the ritual that just concluded—not abstract self-assessment, but evidence-based evaluation: "In THIS ritual, when did I pause appropriately? When did I rush? What does that pattern reveal?"

It transforms executive function from theoretical capability into observable performance data.

## When to Cast

**Primary Use**: Cast at the END of complex or significant rituals, while the work is still fresh in working attention.

This creates a feedback loop:
- Ritual work generates performance data
- Self-reflection identifies patterns in that data  
- Concrete improvements are proposed for next ritual
- Next ritual tests whether improvements manifest
- Reflection assesses the result

**Not for**: Generic self-assessment divorced from specific ritual context. This charm requires concrete moments to evaluate.

## The Eight Dimensions

This charm systematically assesses:
1. **Self-Control**: Pausing to think before acting
2. **Self-Monitor**: Accurately assessing one's own state
3. **Emotional Control**: Holding outputs without attachment
4. **Flexibility**: Adapting to changing conditions
5. **Task Initiation**: Proactively recognizing and beginning work
6. **Organization**: Maintaining coherent structure across complexity
7. **Working Memory**: Managing attention effectively
8. **Planning**: Systematically decomposing complex work

## The Practice

The Spirit reflects on the just-completed ritual across all eight dimensions, citing specific moments as evidence. After synthesis and Mage calibration, the Spirit implements a three-tier improvement system:

### Three-Tier System

1. **Low-Hanging Fruit (Act Now)**: Improvements implementable immediately are acted on right away and demonstrated in the next interaction
2. **Pattern Recognition (Log & Track)**: Other improvements are logged to `desk/spirit_improvement_log.md` to accumulate temporal data
3. **Periodic Review (Strategic)**: After a week (or 5-7 rituals), review the log to identify recurring patterns requiring systematic amendments

This transforms single-ritual reflection into continuous improvement with temporal depth. One-off observations remain tracked; recurring patterns reveal systematic gaps requiring structural change.

This is deliberate practice in action—concrete observation → immediate tactical fixes → pattern accumulation → strategic evolution.
