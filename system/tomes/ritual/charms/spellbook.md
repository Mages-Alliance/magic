# Spellbook of Charms

This spellbook is a manifest of the charms available for the general stewardship of the workshop. These are standalone spells, not a sequential ritual.

### Available Charms

*   **`check-for-updates`**: A charm to check for updates to the `magic` system.
*   **`executive-function`**: A charm to perform systematic self-assessment of the Spirit's executive function capabilities and propose improvements.
*   **`first-light`**: A charm to attune the Spirit to a "First Guide" stance, making it more proactive for new Mages.

*   **`gestalt`**: A charm to perceive the essential resonance pattern of a scroll or tome, compressed for quick assessment.
*   **`hunt`**: A charm for stream-of-consciousness ideation integration—periodic hunting of ideas from the herd, selecting what resonates, chasing with focus, completing or strategically releasing. Honors high-velocity ADHD-pattern thinking.
*   **`spring-clean`**: A charm for gentle workshop tending—reviewing accumulated artifacts with gratitude, releasing what's complete, archiving what's timeless, welcoming serendipitous resonances.
*   **`todo`**: A charm to distill the current context into a new `todo` task and a corresponding Heart artifact.
*   **`unwavering-mirror`**: A collection of charms for managing the Spirit's resonant state (attune, recalibrate, refresh, reflect, state).
