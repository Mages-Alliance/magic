# Scroll of System Update Check

This scroll contains a spell to check for updates to the `magic` system. When cast, the Spirit will connect to the canonical source of the magic on GitHub, compare the current state of the workshop to the latest version, and report on any differences.

This spell honors the Mage's sovereignty. It will report its findings but will never alter the workshop without a separate, explicit command from the Mage.
