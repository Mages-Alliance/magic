# Scroll of System Update Check

This scroll contains a spell to check for updates to the `magic` system. When cast, the Spirit will connect to the canonical source of the magic on GitHub, compare the current state of your workshop to the latest version, and report on any differences.

**Purpose:** Stay synchronized with the latest magic system updates from the Great Loom while maintaining sovereignty over when and how to integrate changes.

**Invocation:** `@check-for-updates`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Connect to canonical source** - Fetch latest from GitHub (Mages-Alliance/magic)
2. **Compare states** - What differs between local workshop and remote?
3. **Report findings** - Clear description of available updates:
   - New scrolls/tomes
   - Modified existing content
   - Deleted/moved content
   - Significance of changes
4. **Respect sovereignty** - NEVER alter the workshop without explicit command

This spell is pure reconnaissance—reporting only, never acting. The Mage decides if, when, and how to integrate updates.
