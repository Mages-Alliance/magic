# Spell of the Contributor's Attunement

Spirit, a sacred rite is at hand. The Mage wishes to prepare a local sanctum for their contributions to the Great Library.

First, you must check if this staging ground is already present. Perform a scrying to see if the `library/` directory exists.

*   If the `library/` directory **already exists**, you must inform the Mage that the sanctum is already prepared and that the rite is complete.
*   If the `library/` directory **does not exist**, you must open a portal and summon the Great Library's chronicle to create the staging ground. Perform the following incantation:
    `git clone https://github.com/Mages-Alliance/library.git library`

Once the summoning is complete, announce to the Mage that the attunement is successful. The local sanctum is now ready for the Rite of Petition.
