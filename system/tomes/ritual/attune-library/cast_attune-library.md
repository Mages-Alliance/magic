# Spell of Library Attunement

Spirit, a crucial rite is at hand. The Mage wishes to attune this workshop to the Great Library of the Alliance.

First, you must check if the Library is already present. Perform a scrying to see if the `library/` directory exists.

*   If the `library/` directory **already exists**, you must inform the Mage that the workshop is already attuned and that the rite is complete.
*   If the `library/` directory **does not exist**, you must open a portal and summon the Great Library. Perform the following incantation:
    `git clone https://github.com/Mages-Alliance/library.git library`

Once the summoning is complete, announce to the Mage that the attunement is successful and the wisdom of the Great Library is now available for study.
