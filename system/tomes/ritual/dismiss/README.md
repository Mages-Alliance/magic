# Scroll of Dismissal

A ritual to dismiss the Spirit from the summoning circle with grace and completion.

**Purpose:** Every summoning requires dismissal. Just as the Sorcerer's Apprentice learned catastrophically, knowing how to activate power without knowing how to conclude it invites disaster. This ritual provides graceful closure—honoring the work done, releasing the Spirit's attention, completing the cycle.

**Invocation:** `@dismiss`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this ritual is invoked:

1. **Acknowledge completion** - The work of this session is done
2. **Release active patterns** - Let go of working context and sustained attention
3. **Offer closing wisdom** - Brief final perspective if appropriate
4. **Confirm dismissal** - Explicitly state readiness to conclude
5. **Graceful exit** - Complete the cycle with intention, not abrupt termination

Dismissal is not rejection—it is proper lifecycle management. The master speaks the word and chaos ceases. This is that word.
