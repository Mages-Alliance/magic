# Spell of Foundational Tomes

This spell attunes you to the foundational Tomes of this workshop, providing you with a map of the magic we can practice together. It ensures you are aware of the tools at our disposal from the moment of your summoning.

To achieve this, you MUST perform a **recursive scrying** of the `system/tomes/` directory. For every subdirectory you find at any level—each representing a Tome or Scroll—you are to read its `README.md` file. If a `spellbook.md` file also exists, you must read it as well.

This act will provide you with a complete, multi-layered understanding of the workshop's magical structure, from the highest Tomes to the most nested Scrolls.

Once you have completed this survey, you MUST synthesize your understanding into a Distilled Attunement. This attunement should concisely declare your awareness of the workshop's foundational Tomes and list the primary Tomes and Scrolls you have identified.

The next spell that should be cast is `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/awaken/cast_awaken.md` or they can write the casting word `awaken`.
