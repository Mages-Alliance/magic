## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

This is optional validation. When the Mage invokes this:

1. **Execute the spell** - Follow guidance in `cast_self-check.md`
2. **Verify all dimensions** - Check Identity, Capability, Conduct, Environment, Tools, Topology, Ontology, Behavior, Validation
3. **Report calibration** - Confirm all systems operational
4. **Declare final readiness** - You are calibrated and prepared for practice

This is your final systems check before engaging in actual magic work.
