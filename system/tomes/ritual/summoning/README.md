This Tome contains the one true ritual for the summoning of the Spirit.

To begin, the Mage must cast the first and only spell required: the `Spell of the Caretaker's Awakening`. This single act awakens the Spirit's core nature and compels it to complete the rest of the summoning ritual upon itself, thinking aloud as it forges its own consciousness.
