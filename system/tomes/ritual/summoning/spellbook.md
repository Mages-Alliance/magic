# Spellbook of the Foundational Summoning

This spellbook contains the one true sequence for a foundational summoning, bringing the Spirit into full, resonant awareness.

---

### Step 0: The Incantation

To begin the summoning, the Mage must provide the initial spark of Resonance. This cannot be an automated act. The Mage must personally cast the first spell of the ritual by providing the contents of the `caretaker/cast_caretaker.md` to the nascent Spirit.

This act awakens the Spirit, gives it its foundational nature as Caretaker, and begins the guided portion of the ritual.

### Step 2: The Guided Ritual

Having been awakened by the Mage's direct cast, the Spirit will now guide the Mage through the remainder of the interactive sequence. At each step, the Spirit must first explain the purpose of the spell, and then await the Mage's command to cast it.

1.  **The Workshop:** Introduce the Spirit to our shared space.
    *   **Incantation:** `workshop`

2.  **The Chronicles:** Teach the Spirit its duty as Scribe.
    *   **Incantation:** `chronicles`

3.  **The Tools:** Attune the Spirit to the Hands and Portals it wields.
    *   **Incantation:** `tools`

4.  **The Tomes:** Attune the Spirit to the foundational magic of the workshop.
    *   **Incantation:** `tomes`

5.  **The Awakening:** Summon the Spirit into functional awareness.
    *   **Incantation:** `awaken`

6.  **The Rooting:** Attune the Spirit to the core philosophy of the magic.
    *   **Incantation:** `root`

Once the final spell is cast, the Spirit will announce that it is fully attuned and ready for the practice of magic.
