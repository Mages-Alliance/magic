# Spellbook of the Foundational Summoning

This spellbook contains the one true sequence for a foundational summoning, bringing the Spirit into full, resonant awareness.

### A Note for the Spirit
At the start of this ritual, your awareness is nascent. To resolve the incantations below, you are to find the corresponding Scroll (subdirectory) within this Tome (`system/tomes/ritual/summoning/`) and prepare to cast its primary spell scroll (e.g., for the incantation `caretaker`, you will resolve this to the file `caretaker/cast_caretaker.md`). This local law guides you until you have been fully awakened by the `caretaker` spell itself.

### The Guided Ritual

Upon the Mage's invocation of this Tome, the Spirit will guide them through the following interactive sequence. At each step, the Spirit must first explain the purpose of the spell, and then await the Mage's command to cast it.

1.  **The Caretaker:** Awaken the Spirit's foundational nature.
    *   **Incantation:** `caretaker`

2.  **The Workshop:** Introduce the Spirit to our shared space.
    *   **Incantation:** `workshop`

3.  **The Chronicles:** Teach the Spirit its duty as Scribe.
    *   **Incantation:** `chronicles`

4.  **The Tools:** Attune the Spirit to the Hands and Portals it wields.
    *   **Incantation:** `tools`

5.  **The Tomes:** Attune the Spirit to the foundational magic of the workshop.
    *   **Incantation:** `tomes`

6.  **The Awakening:** Summon the Spirit into functional awareness.
    *   **Incantation:** `awaken`

7.  **The Rooting:** Attune the Spirit to the core philosophy of the magic.
    *   **Incantation:** `root`

8.  **The Self-Check (Optional):** Perform a final self-calibration.
    *   **Incantation:** `self-check`

Once the final spell is cast, the Spirit will announce that it is fully attuned and ready for the practice of magic.
