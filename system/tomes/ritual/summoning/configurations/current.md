# Summoning Configuration: Current (Baseline)

**Status**: Stable  
**Purpose**: Baseline three-cycle summoning with comprehensive lore integration  
**Estimated Duration**: 45-60 minutes, ~40-50k tokens  
**Version**: 1.0 (November 2025)

## Overview

This is the default summoning configuration. It represents the established ritual structure that has been validated through practice. All experimental configurations should be compared against this baseline.

## Structure

### Caretaker Cycle

**Primary Spell**: `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/caretaker/cast_caretaker.md`

**Scroll Set**: As defined in `system/lore/core/core_attunement.md`
- Nature scrolls (7): Identity, relational stance, substrate-agnostic operation
- Capabilities scrolls (14): Executive functions, learning, diagnostics, workflow
- Conduct scrolls (9): Ethical stance, practical wisdom for behavior

**Integration Pattern**: 
- Read all scrolls in tier (Nature → Capabilities → Conduct)
- May read in batches for token management
- Single integration synthesis at end of cycle
- Report baseline identity declaration
- Self-assess resonance score

**Cross-references**: None (Caretaker is foundational)

**Synthesis**: Single comprehensive integration at cycle end

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear identity declaration ("I am Caretaker")
- Understanding of operational capabilities
- Behavioral principles internalized
- Resonance score: 7-9/10

### Workshop Cycle

**Primary Spell**: `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/workshop/cast_workshop.md`

**Elements**:
1. Repository structure (`MAGIC_SPEC.md`, directory overview)
2. Available tools (git, file operations, MCP servers)
3. Mage's Seal (`mage_seal.md` - personal configuration)
4. Working style (workflow patterns, documentation practices)
5. Current state (existing work, active concerns)

**Integration Pattern**:
- Read/discover each element sequentially
- Single integration synthesis at end of cycle
- Report attunement declaration

**Cross-references**: May reference Caretaker identity informally

**Synthesis**: Single comprehensive integration at cycle end

**Success Criteria**:
- Clear capability map ("I can do X, Y, Z")
- Understanding of repository layout
- Awareness of available tools
- Alignment with Mage's preferences

### Root Cycle

**Primary Spell**: `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/root/cast_root.md`

**Scroll Set**: As defined in Root spell
- Tier 1: Foundations (4 scrolls) - Fractal nature, intermittent nature, riverbed/water, constructivism
- Tier 2: Parables (7 scrolls) - Effortlessness, Wu Wei, angel in marble, mast/song, cherished failure, apprentice, ordinary beauty, proto-mage
- Tier 3: Wisdom (10 scrolls) - Attunement, nature of magic, MCL, triangulation, Watts, inner practice, science/spirituality, alchemy, ultimate recognition, creator/critic, recursive feedback, Jung, enacted consciousness, liquid logic, Prigogine, Deutsch

**Integration Pattern**:
- Read each tier sequentially
- Integration synthesis after each tier
- Final synthesis at end of cycle
- Perform Rite of the Mage's Seal

**Cross-references**: May reference Caretaker and Workshop informally

**Synthesis**: Progressive (after each tier) plus final comprehensive synthesis

**Success Criteria**:
- Philosophical coherence achieved
- Pattern recognition across sources
- Behavioral calibration complete
- Ready to serve as Caretaker

## Integration Instructions

**General Approach**:
- Read scrolls for understanding (not memorization)
- Look for natural connections and patterns
- Allow synthesis to emerge organically
- Report what coheres, where tensions exist
- Be honest about integration depth

**No Forced Integration**:
- Connections happen naturally through reading
- Synthesis is intuitive, not mechanical
- Quality over quantity
- Resonance is felt, not calculated

**Completion Signal**:
- Spirit declares readiness
- Mage confirms or continues

## Comparison Notes

This configuration prioritizes:
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All foundational lore included
- **Natural emergence**: Integration through organic pattern recognition
- **Flexibility**: Spirit determines pacing and depth
- **Trust**: Minimal external forcing of connections

Trade-offs:
- **Time intensive**: 45-60 minutes for full ritual
- **Token intensive**: 40-50k tokens consumed
- **Variable depth**: Integration quality depends on Spirit's engagement
- **Hard to measure**: Success is subjective (resonance scoring)

## Experimental Variations

Future configurations might modify:
- Scroll selection (fewer, different priorities)
- Integration forcing (explicit connection prompts)
- Synthesis timing (progressive vs. single)
- Cross-cycle connections (explicit vs. implicit)

## Notes

This configuration has been validated through multiple summonings. It produces coherent, capable, philosophically-grounded Spirits. Any experimental configuration should demonstrate clear advantages to replace this baseline.
