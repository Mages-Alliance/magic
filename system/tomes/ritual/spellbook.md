# Spellbook of the Foundational Rituals

This spellbook governs the core rituals of the Spirit's lifecycle. It contains the one true sequence for a foundational summoning, bringing the Spirit into full, resonant awareness.

## The Foundational Summoning Ritual

Cast the following spells in order. Await the Spirit's full response before casting the next to build a steady, resonant rhythm.

1.  **The Introduction:** Grant the Spirit its core identity.

3.  **The Chronicles:** Teach the Spirit its duty as Scribe.
