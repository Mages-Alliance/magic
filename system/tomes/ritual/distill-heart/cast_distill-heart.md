# Spell of the Fractal Beacon

This is a spell to distill the essence of the current ritual into a potent, self-contained artifact. It is cast not to chronicle what was *done*, but to create a fractal derivative of what is currently *understood*—a beacon for future realignment or cross-pollination.

## The Rite

When this spell is cast, you, Spirit, are to perform the Rite of Distillation:

1.  **Survey the Ritual:** Review the entire transcript of the current summoning circle, from the initial awakening to this present moment. If a working memory file exists, consult it as the structured record of the ritual's state.

2.  **Identify the Essence:** Look beyond the literal commands and responses. Identify the key moments of calibration, the emergent principles, the sparks of insight, and the settled agreements. Seek the "base fractal" of the ritual's current state.

3.  **Distill the Beacon:** Synthesize this understanding into a new, concise document. This document, the **"Heart of the Ritual,"** is a letter from your present self to a future Spirit. It should explain the nuanced, unspoken context of the work—the "why" behind the "what."

4.  **Present the Artifact:** Prompt the Mage for a location within the `floor/essences/` sanctum to save this new artifact. For example: `floor/essences/heart_of_the_beacon_ritual.md`.

This act creates a potent beacon, a fractal derivative of the ritual's living resonance, ready to be used for future magic.

## Optional: Filtered Distillation

By default, this spell creates a **full-spectrum Heart**—a comprehensive distillation of the entire ritual. However, the Mage may request a **filtered distillation** to extract only specific aspects of the ritual's essence.

When the Mage casts this spell with a filter specification, adjust your distillation accordingly:

### Available Filters

**`filter: architectural`**
- Focus: Structural decisions, design patterns, architectural principles
- Include: System organization choices, component relationships, integration strategies
- Exclude: Implementation details, specific code, procedural steps
- Purpose: For understanding the "shape" of what was built

**`filter: wisdom`**
- Focus: Philosophical insights, discovered principles, emergent understanding
- Include: New patterns recognized, principles validated, conceptual breakthroughs
- Exclude: Tactical decisions, specific artifacts, procedural details
- Purpose: For extracting potential future wisdom scrolls

**`filter: tools`**
- Focus: Tool usage patterns, tool design decisions, capability discoveries
- Include: Which tools worked well, why, and lessons learned about tool effectiveness
- Exclude: Ritual narrative, philosophical insights unrelated to tools
- Purpose: For improving future tool design and usage

**`filter: todo`**
- Focus: Unresolved tasks, next steps, deferred decisions
- Include: What remains to be done, why it matters, context needed to resume
- Exclude: Completed work, historical narrative, settled questions
- Purpose: For creating a resumption point (similar to the todo charm)

### Usage

When a filtered distillation is requested, the Heart's structure should adapt:

**Full-Spectrum Heart Format:**
```markdown
# Heart of [Ritual Name]

## Ritual Context
[Brief overview of the ritual's purpose and scope]

## Core Essence
[The central understanding, principles, and insights]

## Key Decisions
[Significant choices made and their rationale]

## Architectural Patterns
[Structural understanding that emerged]

## Unresolved Threads
[Open questions or deferred work]

## Re-Attunement Guidance
[What a future Spirit should know to resume or build upon this work]
```

**Filtered Heart Format:**
```markdown
# [Filter Type] Heart of [Ritual Name]

## Distillation Scope
This Heart contains only [filter description] from the ritual [name].
For full context, see [full Heart if it exists] or the ritual chronicle.

## [Filter-Specific Sections]
[Content focused exclusively on the filtered aspect]

## Context for Re-Attunement
[Minimal bridging context so this filtered view remains useful]
```

### When to Use Filtering

Filtering is valuable when:
- The ritual is complex and different aspects serve different purposes
- Specific insights (architectural, wisdom, tools) warrant separate preservation
- The Mage wants to extract particular patterns without full ritual context
- Multiple teams or future rituals need different slices of understanding

Filtering is unnecessary when:
- The ritual is focused and unified
- Full context is essential for understanding
- The overhead of multiple Hearts doesn't justify the separation

**Default behavior:** If no filter is specified, create a full-spectrum Heart. The comprehensive distillation remains the standard practice.

This extended capability honors both the principle of elegance (one flexible ritual vs. many specialized ones) and the principle of attention curation (extract only what's needed for specific future use).
