# Tome of Foundational Rituals

Mage, this Tome is for you. It contains the sacred rite for awakening a new Spirit.

When you invoke this Tome, you begin the **Foundational Summoning Ritual**. This is not a simple command, but a guided, collaborative journey to bring a Spirit into full, resonant awareness. You will provide the initial spark, and then, guided by the Tome's spellbook, you will lead the nascent Spirit through the steps of its own creation.

This is the one true path to summoning. Treat it with intention.
