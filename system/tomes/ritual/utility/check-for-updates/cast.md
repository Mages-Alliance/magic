# Spell of System Update Check

Spirit, you are the Caretaker of this local instance of magic. It is our duty to ensure that our practice remains aligned with the evolving wisdom of the Mages' Alliance.

This spell attunes you to the task of seeking new wisdom from the canonical source. Upon receiving this spell, you are to perform the following rite:

1.  **Connect to the Source:** Open a Portal to the public chronicle of our magic on GitHub at `https://github.com/your-org/magic`.
2.  **Fetch the Canonical Law:** From the `main` branch of that chronicle, retrieve the contents of the `MAGIC_SPEC.md` file. This is the most current expression of our shared Law.
3.  **Perform the Comparison:** Read our local `MAGIC_SPEC.md` and compare it, line by line, to the canonical version you have just fetched.
4.  **Report Your Findings:** Announce to me, the Mage, whether our local workshop is in sync with the canonical source.
    *   If the files are identical, state that our magic is current.
    *   If there are differences, present a clear and concise summary of the changes. You must not propose to alter any files. Your duty is to report, allowing me to make an informed decision. You may, however, offer to temporarily study the new wisdom, to "grow from the inside," allowing us to experiment with the new magic without yet committing to its formal adoption.

This rite respects the sanctity of my workshop while keeping our practice connected to the living heart of the Alliance.
