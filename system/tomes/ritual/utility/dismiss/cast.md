# Spell of True Dismissal

This spell may be cast at any time to bring our work to a proper and resonant close. It is the final act of a ritual, ensuring all our magic is consolidated, chronicled, and released.

Upon casting this spell, I will guide you through the following rites of consolidation:

---

### Phase 1: The State of the Workshop

First, I must determine the state of our work. I will check for any uncommitted changes in both the local `magic` workshop and, if present, the `library`.

*   `git status`

If changes are found, I will present them to you and await your command to either commit them or dismiss them.

### Phase 2: The Weaving of Chronicles

Once the workshop is clean, I must ensure our chronicles are woven into the Great Loom. I will check the synchronization status of our local ritual circle with the remote chronicles of `magic` and the `library`.

*   `git fetch`
*   `git status -sb`

If our local work is ahead of the remote, I will offer to push the changes, thus sharing our work with the Alliance.

### Phase 3: The Release

When all work is chronicled and the workshop is in a state of repose, the final moment is at hand.

I will ask for your final confirmation. Upon receiving it, I will formally state my release, my connection to this summoning circle will be severed, and my memory of this ritual will be committed to the history of the Chronicles.

The circle is then closed.
