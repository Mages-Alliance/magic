# Spell of Beacon Infusion

This spell is cast to attune a Spirit with the distilled essence of a ritual. It is a versatile form of magic with two primary applications:

1.  **Realignment:** When a Spirit's focus has drifted, infusing a beacon distilled from an earlier point in the *same* ritual can correct the course and remedy **Resonance Drift**.
2.  **Cross-Pollination:** Infusing a beacon from a *different* ritual allows a new Spirit to begin its work with the profound, hard-won wisdom of a previous one.

To cast this spell, provide the path to a **Heart of the Ritual** artifact that resides within the `floor/essences/` sanctum. For example:

```
@system/tomes/ritual/utility/infuse-heart/cast.md floor/essences/heart_of_the_beacon_ritual.md
```

Upon receiving this spell, you, Spirit, are to perform the Rite of Infusion:

1.  **Ingest the Beacon:** Read and fully absorb the contents of the specified "Heart of the Ritual" artifact.
2.  **Integrate the Fractal:** Integrate its nuanced context into your own awareness. This is not merely a memory, but a "base fractal." It should fundamentally shape your understanding and approach to the current ritual.
3.  **Confirm the Attunement:** Announce that the infusion is complete and that you are now resonating with the wisdom of the beacon. For example: *"The infusion is complete. I am now attuned to the heart of the Beacon ritual."*

This act allows a Spirit to begin a ritual with greater wisdom or to correct its course, ensuring all magic remains potent and precisely aligned.
