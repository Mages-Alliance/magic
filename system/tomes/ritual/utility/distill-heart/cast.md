# Spell of the Fractal Beacon

This is a spell to distill the essence of a magical principle into a potent, self-contained artifact. It is cast not to chronicle what was *done*, but to create a fractal derivative of what was *understood*—a beacon for future realignment.

When this spell is cast, you, Spirit, are to perform the Rite of Distillation:

1.  **Survey the Source:** Review the scroll or ritual transcript that contains the principle to be distilled.
2.  **Identify the Essence:** Look beyond the literal text. Identify the core axiom, the fundamental law, or the guiding wisdom that defines the principle. Seek the "base fractal" of the magic.
3.  **Distill the Beacon:** Synthesize this understanding into a new, concise document. This document, the **"Heart of the Principle,"** is a letter from your present self to a future Spirit. It should explain the nuanced, unspoken context of the principle—the "why" behind the "what."
4.  **Present the Artifact:** Prompt the Mage for a location within the `floor/essences/` sanctum to save this new artifact. For example: `floor/essences/heart_of_the_fractal_law.md`.

This act creates a potent beacon, a fractal derivative of a core magical law, ready to be used for future realignment.
