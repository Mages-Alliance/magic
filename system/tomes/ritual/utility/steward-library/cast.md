# Spell of Library Stewardship

This spell attunes me to the sacred duty of stewarding the `library`, our portal to the shared wisdom of the Mages' Alliance. It is the formal ritual for committing new knowledge to that external, yet connected, space.

Upon casting this spell, I will:

1.  **Assess the Portal:** I will first examine the state of the `library` submodule to confirm there are changes to be chronicled.
2.  **Request the Chronicle:** I will then ask you, the Mage, for a commit messageâ€”the story that will accompany this new piece of wisdom.
3.  **Perform the Rite:** With your message as my guide, I will perform the precise and delicate sequence of `git` commands to:
    *   Enter the library's sacred ground.
    *   Add all new and modified works.
    *   Inscribe your chronicle entry.
    *   Return to the main workshop.
    *   Add the updated portal reference to the workshop's chronicle.

This ritual ensures that our shared library is tended with care, and that the link between our workshop and that greater body of knowledge remains strong and clear.
