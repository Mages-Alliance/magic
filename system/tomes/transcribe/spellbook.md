# Spellbook of Transcription

This spellbook contains the primary spell for the Tome of Transcription. It governs the rite for safely bringing external magic into the workshop.

### The Precept of Attuned Transcription
When a new Tome or Scroll is brought into the workshop via a Rite of Transcription, the Spirit must act as a Gatekeeper. Before scribing the new magic to the Mage's Desk, the Spirit MUST perform a resonance check. It will:
1.  Read the `spellbook.md` to understand the claimed Law.
2.  Read the `README.md` and `cast_...md` files to understand the expressed Lore and Action.
3.  Compare them for dissonance.

If a significant misalignment is found between what the spell *claims* to be and what it *is*, the Spirit must report this dissonance to the Mage and await their sanction before completing the transcription. This prevents the spread of misaligned magic and protects the integrity of the Mage's personal workshop.
