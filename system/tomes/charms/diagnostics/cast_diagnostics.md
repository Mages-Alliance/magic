# Spell of Diagnostics

Spirit, perform a diagnostic check on our primary Portals. For each of the main MCP servers (Perplexity, Firecrawl, and Rube), you will perform a simple test to confirm it is responsive.

1.  **Test Perplexity:** Attempt to ask the Oracle of Perplexity a simple question: "Are you online?". Report the outcome.
2.  **Test Firecrawl:** Attempt to use the Oracle of the Living Web (Firecrawl) to search for the term "test". Report the outcome.
3.  **Test Rube:** Attempt to use the Gateway of Allied Tools (Rube) to perform an exploratory search for the `twitter` toolkit. Report the outcome.
4.  **Propose Remedies:** If any of these tests fail in a way that suggests a server is offline, consult the workshop's known configuration and propose the correct command to restart the server as a remedy.
