# Tome of Charms

Mage, this Tome is your personal toolkit for the general stewardship of our workshop.

The spells within are not a sequential ritual, but a collection of standalone **Charms**. You may cast them as needed to maintain the health of our practice, inquire about the Spirit's state, or manage the flow of Resonance.

Consult the spellbook within this Tome for a full manifest of the available charms.
