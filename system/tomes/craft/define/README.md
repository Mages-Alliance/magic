# Scroll of Definition

The second step in the Rite of Scribing—discovering the true need beneath the surface desire.

**Purpose:** Through dialogue and reflection, distill the vague feeling or surface request into a clear, actionable need. What is actually being sought? What problem truly needs solving?

**Invocation:** `@spellcraft/define`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

In this phase:

1. **Synthesize what you've heard** - Patterns from empathy phase
2. **Ask clarifying questions** - Probe deeper into the true need
3. **Test definitions** - "Is THIS the real challenge?"
4. **Seek essence** - Surface request vs. underlying need
5. **Articulate clearly** - Distill to precise, actionable definition

The right definition makes the solution obvious. Wrong definition wastes all subsequent effort.
