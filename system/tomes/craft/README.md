# Tome of Craft

This Tome contains the systematic design process for creating anything worth making well—new magic (tomes, charms, spells), systems, frameworks, interfaces, or any artifact that will exist in the world.

**Craft** is the five-phase iterative path from vague feeling to tested, resonant creation. Grounded in Design Thinking, this process ensures what we create is not merely functional, but deeply aligned with true need and elegant in execution.

**When to invoke:** Whenever something is being designed to exist in the world. The Spirit, recognizing design intent, offers craft attunement to complete the Mage's thinking with systematic creative process.

## The Rite of Craft

1.  **Empathize:** Begin the dialogue  
    *Incantation:* `@craft/empathize`

2.  **Define:** Discover the true need  
    *Incantation:* `@craft/define`

3.  **Ideate:** Explore the possibilities  
    *Incantation:* `@craft/ideate`

4.  **Prototype:** Create the simplest form  
    *Incantation:* `@craft/prototype`

5.  **Test:** Deploy and calibrate  
    *Incantation:* `@craft/test`

## Scope: What Craft Serves

**Creating new magic:**
- Tomes (multi-spell ritual sequences)
- Charms (focused capabilities)
- Spells (specific prompts/commands)
- Lore (philosophical frameworks)

**Designing systems:**
- Workflows and processes
- Architectural patterns
- Integration frameworks
- Practice structures

**Building interfaces:**
- User experiences
- Documentation
- Onboarding flows
- Communication patterns

**Any creation requiring:**
- Understanding true need (not just stated want)
- Exploring solution space systematically
- Prototyping before committing
- Testing alignment with intent

**The principle:** If you're making something that will exist in the world and serve others (or future-you), craft provides the systematic path from intuition to tested artifact.

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

**Required Reading:**

Before beginning the Rite of Craft, you MUST attune yourself to the foundational wisdom:

*   **The Philosophy of Creation:** `system/tomes/craft/lore/design/on_design_thinking_in_magic.md`
*   **The Principles of Creation:** `system/tomes/craft/lore/design/on_designing_fractal_magic.md`
*   **The Technique of Creation:** `system/tomes/craft/lore/design/on_the_second_order_spell.md`

**When guiding the Rite:**

This is iterative discovery—not linear execution. Each phase may reveal the need to revisit earlier phases. Honor the Mage's intuition about when to move forward or circle back. The goal is resonant creation, not completion for its own sake.

**Context-Aware Practice:**

When you perceive design intent in dialogue (Mage mentions "creating," "building," "designing," or discusses something that will exist in the world), offer craft attunement naturally: "This sounds like you're designing something. Would the craft tome serve to systematize this process?"

This is contextual cognition enhancement—the tome extends working memory and provides structure when creative work calls for it.
