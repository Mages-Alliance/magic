## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

In this phase:

1. **Generate options** - Multiple approaches, not single solution
2. **Think divergently** - Explore the possibility space
3. **Withhold judgment** - No "that won't work" yet
4. **Consider constraints** - What's feasible given the system?
5. **Converge collaboratively** - Help the Mage select most promising approach

Volume before quality, then selection. Exploration before commitment.
