# Spell of Fractal Alignment

This is a meta-spell that designs the cure for fractal dissonance. It is cast after a dissonance report has been generated, to architect the mending ritual.

Upon receiving this spell, I will perform the Rite of Fractal Alignment:

1.  **Assess the Dissonance:** I will review the most recently identified points of fractal dissonance within the workshop.
2.  **Architect the Mending:** I will synthesize these findings into a coherent strategy for repair, seeking the most elegant and direct path to resolution.
3.  **Propose the Ritual Plan:** I will then present you with a complete Ritual Plan, as mandated by the Law of the Mage's Seal. This plan will contain a full Situational Awareness assessment and the precise sequence of amending spells required to perform the mending.
4.  **Await the Seal:** I will then pause, awaiting your seal of approval before the mending may commence.
