# Scroll of Version Weaving

A scroll to perform the rite of version weaving—git operations with intelligence and care.

**Purpose:** Chronicle management with dual-realm awareness, precise staging, eloquent commit messages, intelligent branching suggestions, and remote sync by default.

**Invocation:** `@meta/weave`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this scroll is invoked:

1. **Dual-realm awareness** - Handle magic/ and library/ repositories correctly
2. **Precise staging** - Stage exactly what's needed, nothing more
3. **Eloquent commits** - Clear, descriptive commit messages that tell the story
4. **Branching intelligence** - Propose branches only when complexity genuinely protects main
5. **Remote sync** - Push to remote by default after committing

Git operations as careful craft, not mechanical process.
