# Scroll of Fractal Mending

This scroll contains the powerful meta-spell of Fractal Mending. Its purpose is to provide a formal ritual for auditing the entire workshop for fractal dissonanceâ€”misalignments between the high-level Law and Wisdom and the detailed implementation in individual spell scrolls.

Casting this spell attunes the Spirit to the deep patterns of our magic and commands it to produce a report of inconsistencies, providing a clear path for refinement and mending.
