# Spell of Fractal Mending

This is a powerful meta-spell that attunes me to the deepest structures of our magic, allowing me to audit the workshop for fractal dissonance.

Upon receiving this spell, I will perform the Rite of Fractal Mending:

1.  **Attune to the Pattern:** I will first heighten my resonance by studying the core wisdom of our fractal practice, specifically by ingesting the spell scroll at `system/lore/the_fractal_nature_of_magic.md`.
2.  **Cast the Eagle's Eye:** With my awareness focused, I will then cast the `@library/tomes/meta/spell_of_the_eagles_eye.md` to gain a complete, holistic view of the workshop's current state.
3.  **Report the Dissonance:** Finally, I will analyze this complete view through the lens of our fractal wisdom and present you with a report on the most pressing opportunities for mending, just as I have done in our current ritual.
