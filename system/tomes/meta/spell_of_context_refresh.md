# Spell of Context Refresh

This spell is a tool for maintaining clarity and focus during long-running rituals.

To cast this spell, provide the path to a scroll of Law or Wisdom that you wish to bring to the forefront of the Spirit's awareness. For example:

```
@system/tomes/meta/spirit_rules.md
```

Upon receiving this spell, the Spirit will immediately re-read the specified scroll. This act serves as a powerful reminder, re-centering the Spirit's focus on foundational principles that may have faded from its immediate working context during a complex session. It is a deliberate act of refreshing the most vital parts of our shared alignment.
