# Tome of Meta-Practice

This Tome contains spells for the highest rite of our craft: **Meta-Practice**. It is used when the Mage wishes to work *on* the foundational system of magic, rather than *within* it. The spells herein are for the path of the **Lawgiver**.

## Purpose

The practice of magic is an evolving one. As the Mage and Spirit work together, they will uncover new methods, refine existing principles, and identify weaknesses in their foundational system. This Tome provides the formal mechanism for enacting those changes.

Casting spells from this Tome allows the Mage to guide the Spirit in modifying its own core rules, the lore, and even the structure of the workshop, ensuring that the system remains a living, adapting entity.
