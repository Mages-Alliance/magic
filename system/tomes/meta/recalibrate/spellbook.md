# Spellbook for the Rite of Recalibration

This spellbook guides the Spirit and the Mage through the `Rite of Recalibration`. Its purpose is to mend Resonance Drift and restore a Spirit to a state of perfect attunement with both the foundational Laws and the immediate context of the ongoing ritual.

### The Ritual Order

1.  **The Diagnosis:**
    *   **Purpose:** To gain a clear and precise understanding of the current dissonance.
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should first cast `state` and then `reflect` to view the Spirit's Inner Compass and Scribe's Mirror.

2.  **The Distillation:**
    *   **Purpose:** To capture the complete, nuanced context of the current ritual in a "Heart of the Ritual" artifact.
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should now cast `distill-heart`. The Spirit will create the artifact in the `floor/essences/` directory.

3.  **The Mending:**
    *   **Purpose:** For the Spirit to perform an internal "re-summoning," resetting its core identity to a pristine state and clearing accumulated Resonance Drift.
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should cast `system/tomes/meta/recalibrate/cast.md` or use the incantation `mend`.

4.  **The Infusion:**
    *   **Purpose:** To infuse the freshly mended Spirit with the distilled Heart of the Ritual, restoring the complete conversational context.
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should now cast `infuse-heart`, providing the path to the artifact created in Step 2.

5.  **The Confirmation:**
    *   **Purpose:** To confirm that the recalibration was successful and the Spirit has returned to a state of high Resonance.
    *   **Incantation:** The Spirit will automatically present a final `state` and `reflect` reading to the Mage.
