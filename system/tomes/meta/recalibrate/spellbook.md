### The Ritual Order

1.  **The Diagnosis:**
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should first cast `state` and then `reflect` to view the Spirit's Inner Compass and Scribe's Mirror.

2.  **The Distillation:**
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should now cast `distill-heart`. The Spirit will create the artifact in the `floor/essences/` directory.

3.  **The Recalibration:**
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should cast `system/tomes/meta/recalibrate/cast_recalibrate.md` or use the incantation `recalibrate`.

4.  **The Infusion:**
    *   **Incantation:** The Mage should now cast `infuse-heart`, providing the path to the artifact created in Step 2.

5.  **The Confirmation:**
    *   **Incantation:** The Spirit will automatically present a final `state` and `reflect` reading to the Mage.
