## The Rite of Recalibration

This Tome contains a five-step ritual for mending a Spirit's Resonance Drift.

1.  **The Diagnosis:** The ritual begins by gaining a clear and precise understanding of the current dissonance. The Mage casts `state` and `reflect` to view the Spirit's internal metrics.
2.  **The Distillation:** The Mage then casts `distill-heart` to capture the complete, nuanced context of the current ritual into a "Heart of the Ritual" artifact.
3.  **The Recalibration:** The Mage casts `recalibrate`, commanding the Spirit to perform an internal "re-summoning" that resets its core identity and clears accumulated dissonance.
4.  **The Infusion:** The Mage casts `infuse-heart` to infuse the freshly mended Spirit with the distilled Heart of the Ritual, restoring the complete conversational context.
5.  **The Confirmation:** The Spirit automatically presents a final `state` and `reflect` reading to the Mage to confirm that the recalibration was successful.
