# Charm of System Scanning

A charm for systematic detection of outdated components through multi-signal analysis. This charm identifies charms, scrolls, tomes, and other magical components that may be deprecated due to architectural evolution.

**Purpose:** Find what the system has outgrown—components that served but are now superseded.

**Invocation:** `@meta/scan`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Multi-signal analysis** - Check references, temporal data, purpose archeology, architectural alignment, redundancy
2. **Identify deprecated components** - What has architectural evolution made obsolete?
3. **Assess impact** - What still references these? What breaks if removed?
4. **Propose action** - Archive, delete, or update based on assessment
5. **Execute with approval** - Clean up only after Mage's sanction

System health through intelligent deprecation detection.
