# Charm of Alignment

A charm to check internal consistency and fractal coherence across magic. Context-aware—adapts scope based on what it's applied to.

## Purpose

This charm verifies that magic remains internally consistent and that each part reflects the fractal nature of the whole. It consolidates multiple diagnostic functions into one intelligent charm that infers appropriate scope and adapts its analysis accordingly.

The charm checks for: structural integrity (broken references, missing components), fractal coherence (parts aligning with whole), consistency violations (contradictions in Law/Wisdom), and architectural health.

**Invocation:** `@meta/align [optional-scope]`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Infer scope** - Whole system, specific realm, particular tome, directory, or recent changes
2. **Check structural integrity** - Broken references, missing components
3. **Verify fractal coherence** - Do parts reflect the whole?
4. **Detect contradictions** - Inconsistencies in Law/Wisdom
5. **Report findings** - Clear assessment with specific issues

Adapt analysis depth based on scope—comprehensive for system, focused for specific areas.
