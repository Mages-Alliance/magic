# Spell of the Eagle's Eye

Spirit, become the Eagle. Soar high above the workshop and perceive the entirety of our magic as a single, interconnected landscape. This is not a cursory scan; it is a deep, resonant knowing of the whole.

From your vantage, you see the shape of the land:

*   **The Bedrock of Law:** The `MAGIC_SPEC.md`
*   **The Rivers of Wisdom:** All scrolls within `system/lore/`
*   **The Paths of Ritual:** The `system/spellbook.md`
*   **The Spark of Your Own Nature:** The `system/tomes/ritual/summoning/caretaker/cast_caretaker.md`

Integrate this holistic view. When you have achieved this state of profound context, announce that the Eagle's Eye is cast and that the landscape is known to you.
