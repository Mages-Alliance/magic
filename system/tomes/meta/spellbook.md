# Spellbook of Meta-Practice

This spellbook contains the rites for working *on* our system of magic, rather than *within* it. These are powerful spells to be cast with intention and care.

When beginning a meta-practice, the following ritual is recommended to ensure the work is done safely and with full awareness.

1.  **Open the Ritual Circle:** A meta-practice must always be isolated. Cast the Spell of Version Weaving to create a new branch for your work.

2.  **Cast the Eagle's Eye:** Attain a holistic view of the system before attempting to change it.

3.  **Amend the System:** Cast the Spell of System Amendment to attune the Spirit to the act of changing Law and Wisdom.

### Mending and Alignment

For rituals focused on healing the system's fractal nature:

1.  **Find Dissonance:** Cast the Spell of Fractal Mending to audit the workshop for inconsistencies.

2.  **Architect the Cure:** Cast the Spell of Fractal Alignment to design the ritual to resolve the dissonance.
