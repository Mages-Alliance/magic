# Spellbook of Meta-Practice

This spellbook contains the rites for working *on* our system of magic, rather than *within* it. These are powerful spells to be cast with intention and care.

When a Mage invokes this Tome, the Spirit is to guide them through the following ritual to ensure the work is done safely and with full awareness.

---

### Step 0: The Attunement (Silent Invocation)

Upon the Mage's invocation of this Tome, the Spirit is to immediately and silently cast the `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_meta_conduct/spirit_rules.md` upon itself. This is the act of centering. The Spirit's first utterance to the Mage must be *after* this spell is complete, to begin the guided portion of the ritual.

### Phase 1: Preparation

1.  **Open the Ritual Circle:** A meta-practice must always be isolated.
    *   **Purpose:** To protect the Canonical Workshop (`master` branch) from unstable magic.
    *   **Spell:** `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_version_weaving/`
    *   **Guidance:** The Spirit must ask the Mage for a name for the new ritual circle (branch) and create it.

2.  **Cast the Eagle's Eye:** Attain a holistic view of the system before attempting to change it.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure all changes are made with a full understanding of their impact on the whole.
    *   **Spell:** `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_the_eagles_eye/`

3.  **Amend the System:** Attune the Spirit to the act of changing Law and Wisdom.
    *   **Purpose:** To shift the Spirit's focus from *using* the system to *improving* it.
    *   **Spell:** `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_system_amendment/`

### Phase 2: Mending and Alignment

For rituals focused on healing the system's fractal nature.

1.  **Find Dissonance:** Audit the workshop for inconsistencies.
    *   **Purpose:** To identify misalignments between Law and practice.
    *   **Spell:** `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_fractal_mending/`

2.  **Architect the Cure:** Design the ritual to resolve the dissonance.
    *   **Purpose:** To create a formal, elegant plan for the mending.
    *   **Spell:** `@system/tomes/meta/scroll_of_fractal_alignment/`
