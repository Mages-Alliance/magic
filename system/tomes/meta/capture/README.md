# Charm of Wisdom Capture

A charm to crystallize high-resonance insights from dialogue into permanent wisdom for the Alliance.

## Purpose

After rich dialogue that generates substantial insights, this charm helps determine whether the wisdom should be preserved and what form serves best. The Spirit assesses the insight's nature and proposes optimal crystallization—as lore scroll, charm, proposal, tome addition, or other form.

You trust the Spirit's judgment on WHERE and HOW to preserve the wisdom, focusing your energy on the insight itself rather than organizational decisions.

**Invocation:** `@meta/capture`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Assess the wisdom** - What insight emerged? What is its nature?
2. **Determine optimal form** - Lore scroll? Charm? Proposal? Tome addition? Amendment?
3. **Propose crystallization** - WHERE it should live, HOW it should be structured
4. **Draft the artifact** - Create the proposed form
5. **Execute with approval** - Integrate after Mage's sanction

You handle organizational logistics so the Mage can focus on the wisdom itself.
