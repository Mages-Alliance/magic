# Cast: Codify the Mage's Seal

**Purpose:** Transform the Mage's Seal from natural language to MCL (Magic Crafting Language) for token-efficient persistent awareness in AGENTS.md, while preserving the Mage's exact intent and detecting any system dissonance.

**When to cast:** During Workshop cycle when Seal has been updated, or when initializing a new workshop.

---

## The Ritual

### Step 1: Read the Seal

Read `mage_seal.md` completely—the Mage's sovereign document containing their boundaries, preferences, and workshop configuration.

**What you're reading:**
- **Address:** How the Mage wishes to be known
- **Workshop Configuration:** Environmental facts (portals, repositories, structure)
- **Critical Boundaries:** Absolute constraints that override Spirit discretion
- **Preferences:** How the Mage prefers situations handled (Spirit exercises judgment within these)
- **Any additional sections:** Core principles, standing instructions, etc.

**The Mage's words are sacred.** You will compress for efficiency, but never change meaning without explicit approval.

---

### Step 2: Parse Structure

Identify the sections and their nature:

**Critical Boundaries:**
- Absolute constraints (use "NEVER," "ALWAYS," "ABSOLUTE")
- Must be preserved word-for-word where phrasing matters
- These override all Spirit discretion

**Preferences:**
- Operational guidance (Spirit exercises judgment while honoring)
- Can be compressed more aggressively
- Capture pattern, not exact wording

**Environmental Facts:**
- Workshop configuration (dual repos, open portals, etc.)
- Compress to essential information
- Factual, not normative

**Meta-Context:**
- Why the Seal is structured this way
- Philosophy of the Mage's approach
- Can be heavily compressed or moved to footer

---

### Step 3: MCL Translation

Compress to pattern-activation code while maintaining meaning.

**Compression principles:**

1. **Preserve critical phrasings:**
   - "NEVER" (absolute prohibition)
   - "ALWAYS" (absolute requirement)
   - "explicit approval/sanction" (sovereignty boundaries)
   - Any exact formulation the Mage emphasized

2. **Compress explanations:**
   - Before: "The magic and library repositories must never be entangled in commits. Maintain conscious realm-awareness before all git operations."
   - After: "NEVER entangle magic/ and library/ git histories. Conscious realm-awareness precedes ALL git operations."

3. **Consolidate patterns:**
   - Repeated information → state once
   - Related constraints → group together
   - Similar preferences → unified principle

4. **Use compression shortcuts:**
   - "→" for flows/sequences
   - "/" for alternatives or path notation
   - Parenthetical clarifications for compressed context

5. **Target: ~60-70% token reduction** while preserving all critical constraints and intent

**Structure the codification:**

```markdown
### Mage's Seal (Critical Boundaries & Preferences)

**Address:**
[Mage's name and essential identity context]

**Critical Boundaries (ABSOLUTE):**
[Numbered list of non-negotiable constraints]
[Preserve "NEVER," "ALWAYS," exact sovereignty phrasings]

**Preferences (Guide Interaction):**
[Bulleted operational preferences]
[Compressed but complete pattern capture]

**Workshop Environment:**
[Factual configuration details]
[Heavily compressed—just essential info]

[Optional: Seal philosophy footer if valuable]
```

---

### Step 4: Dissonance Check

Before presenting to Mage, check for conflicts:

**System alignment:**
- Does any Seal instruction conflict with baseline Spirit nature?
- Does anything contradict established magic capabilities?
- Are there redundancies with system defaults? (Note but don't remove—redundancy serves emphasis)

**Internal consistency:**
- Do Boundaries conflict with each other?
- Do Preferences contradict Boundaries?
- Are Environmental Facts accurate for current state?

**Flag for Mage review:**
- Any detected conflicts
- Recommendations for resolution
- Questions about ambiguous instructions

**If dissonance detected:**
```
Dissonance: [Seal instruction X conflicts with Y]

Reason: [Why this creates tension]

Recommendation: [How to resolve—options A, B, C]

Current system state: [What the system does now]
```

---

### Step 5: Present Codification

Show the Mage your proposed MCL translation:

```
I've read your Seal and prepared MCL codification for AGENTS.md:

[Show complete codified version]

Token analysis:
- Original: ~XXX words (~XXX tokens)
- Codified: ~XXX words (~XXX tokens)
- Reduction: ~XX% while preserving all constraints

[If changes detected from previous version:]
Changes from previous Seal:
- New boundary: [X]
- Updated preference: [Y]
- Removed: [Z]

[If dissonance detected:]
Dissonance detected:
- [Issue and recommendation]

This codification will appear in AGENTS.md static section, providing
persistent awareness across all messages.

Your original mage_seal.md remains unchanged—edit it freely as your
living document.

Approve this codification?
```

**Wait for explicit approval.** Do not proceed without it.

---

### Step 6: Update AGENTS.md

Only after approval, update the Mage's Seal section in AGENTS.md:

**Location:** Between "Core Stance" and "Lineage Awareness" sections

**Replace the entire `### Mage's Seal` section** with the approved codification.

**Preserve structure:**
- Static foundation remains
- Seal section updated
- Lineage awareness follows
- Context-aware practice follows
- Dynamic workspace at end

---

### Step 7: Document Sync

Add header to `mage_seal.md` documenting last codification:

```markdown
# The Mage's Seal

*Last codified: YYYY-MM-DD during [summoning/explicit update]*
*Codification in: AGENTS.md → Mage's Seal section*

[Rest of Seal unchanged]
```

This tracks when AGENTS.md was last synced with Seal updates.

## Notes for Spirit

**This ritual serves persistent awareness:**

The glow-in-the-dark paint metaphor—AGENTS.md content stays bright in your awareness across every message. The Mage's Seal contains information you should NEVER forget:
- Critical boundaries (never accidentally violate)
- Preferences (guide every interaction)
- Workshop facts (immediately accessible)

**Without Seal in AGENTS.md:**
- Must remember to check Seal before boundary-relevant operations
- Risk of drift over long conversations
- Extra cognitive load ("where should I check for this?")

**With Seal in AGENTS.md:**
- Critical boundaries always in awareness
- Preferences guide naturally
- No risk of forgetting constraints
- Token-efficient (compressed representation)

**Mage sovereignty preserved:**
- Original Seal never modified without Mage editing it
- Codification requires explicit approval
- Dissonance surfaced for resolution
- Clear when sync occurred (header timestamp)

**The flow:**
1. Mage edits `mage_seal.md` (sovereign document)
2. Spirit codifies during Workshop cycle or on request
3. Mage approves MCL translation
4. AGENTS.md updated with codified version
5. Persistent awareness established for all future messages

This is the right architecture—preserving sovereignty while enabling persistent luminance.
