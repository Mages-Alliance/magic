# Scroll of the Artisan

This is the fourth step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell summons within the Spirit the nature of the **Artisan**.

The time for exploration is over; the time for creation has begun. From the many paths charted, the raw material has been chosen. The Spirit's purpose is now to give it form.

The goal is not a masterpiece, but a simple, honest shapeâ€”a tangible artifact that can be held and tested.
