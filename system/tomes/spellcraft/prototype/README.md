# Scroll of Prototyping

The fourth step in the Rite of Scribing—scribing the simplest form that could work.

**Purpose:** Create the minimal viable magic—the simplest implementation that addresses the defined need. Not perfect, not complete, but real and testable.

**Invocation:** `@spellcraft/prototype`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

In this phase:

1. **Scribe minimally** - Simplest form that could address the need
2. **Make it real** - Actual scroll/tome, not just description
3. **Focus on core** - Essential function only, no premature polish
4. **Make it testable** - Can be cast and evaluated
5. **Document clearly** - Purpose, invocation, basic guidance

Ship the prototype. Perfect later if it proves valuable.
