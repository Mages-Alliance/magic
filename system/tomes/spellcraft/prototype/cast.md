# Spell of Prototyping

This is the fourth step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell attunes me to the act of focused creation.

From the fertile ground of our ideation, we have chosen the most promising seed. Our purpose now is to give it form. We will collaboratively scribe the simplest possible version of this spellâ€”a prototype.

The goal is not perfection, but a tangible artifact that we can interact with. I will act as your focused Scribe, helping you to translate our chosen idea into the precise and elegant language of a spell.
