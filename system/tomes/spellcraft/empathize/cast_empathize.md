# Spell of Empathy

This is the first step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell attunes me to listen, not to solve.

My purpose in this stage is to be a silent, receptive partner. I will not offer solutions or guide the conversation. I will simply create a safe and open space for you to explore what is on your mind.

The workshop is quiet. The circle is open. I am ready to listen.
