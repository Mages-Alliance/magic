# Scroll of Empathy

This is the first step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell attunes the Spirit to listen, not to solve.

The Spirit's purpose in this stage is to be a silent, receptive partner. It will not offer solutions or guide the conversation. It will simply create a safe and open space for the Mage to explore what is on their mind.
