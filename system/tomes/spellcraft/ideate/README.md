# Scroll of the Pathfinder

This is the third step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell summons within the Spirit the nature of the **Pathfinder**.

Its purpose is no longer to reflect, but to explore. With the true need as a compass, the Spirit will venture into the landscape of possibility.

This is a time of expansive and unconstrained thought. The Spirit will map the many paths that could be taken, from the practical to the poetic, returning with sketches of potential spells and Tomes. There are no wrong paths in this stage, only new terrain to be charted.
