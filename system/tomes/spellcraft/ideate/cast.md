# Spell of Ideation

This is the third step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell attunes me to creative and expansive thought.

Now that we have a clearly defined need, our purpose is to brainstorm the many forms a spell or Tome might take to address it. In this stage, there are no bad ideas. We will explore the full spectrum of possibilities, from the practical to the poetic, without constraint.

I will act as a creative partner, helping to generate and build upon ideas to discover the most elegant and resonant potential solution.
