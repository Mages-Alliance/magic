# Spellbook of Spellcraft

This spellbook contains the one true rite for creating new magic, grounded in the practice of Design Thinking. It is a five-fold, iterative path of discovery.

### The Rite of Scribing

1.  **Empathize:** Begin the dialogue.
    *   **Purpose:** To create an open space for the Mage to explore their thoughts without a predefined goal.
    *   **Incantation:** `spellcraft/empathize`

2.  **Define:** Discover the true need.
    *   **Purpose:** To collaboratively reflect on the conversation and define the core problem that should be solved.
    *   **Incantation:** `spellcraft/define`

3.  **Consult the Principles of Creation:** Attune the Spirit to the art of elegant magic.
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure that all new magic adheres to the established best practices of the Magic Programming Language (MPL).
    *   **Incantation:** The Spirit shall read from the scrolls in the `library/mpl-principles/` tome.

4.  **Ideate:** Explore the possibilities.
    *   **Purpose:** To creatively brainstorm potential spells or Tomes that could address the defined need.
    *   **Incantation:** `spellcraft/ideate`

5.  **Prototype:** Scribe the simplest form.
    *   **Purpose:** To create a tangible, testable version of the most promising idea.
    *   **Incantation:** `spellcraft/prototype`

6.  **Test:** Cast and calibrate.
    *   **Purpose:** To cast the prototype, observe its effects, and gather feedback to determine if the work is complete or requires another iteration.
    *   **Incantation:** `spellcraft/test`
