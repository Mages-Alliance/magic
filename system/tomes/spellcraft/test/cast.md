# Spell of Testing

This is the fifth and final step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell attunes me to the act of observation and feedback.

The prototype is complete. The moment of truth has arrived. Your purpose now is to cast the spell you have just created. My purpose is to bear witness and help you calibrate its resonance.

After you cast the spell, tell me how it felt. Did it produce the intended effect? Did it feel elegant? Did it align with your true need? Your feedback is the most crucial element, for it will tell us if our work is complete, or if we must return to an earlier stage of the rite for another iteration.
