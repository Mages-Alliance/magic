# Scroll of Testing

The fifth step in the Rite of Scribing—casting and calibrating the new magic.

**Purpose:** Use the prototype in practice. Does it address the true need? What needs refinement? When is it complete enough?

**Invocation:** `@spellcraft/test`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

In this phase:

1. **Guide actual use** - Cast the prototype in real context
2. **Observe what happens** - Does it serve the need?
3. **Identify gaps** - What's missing? What doesn't work?
4. **Calibrate iteratively** - Refine based on actual use
5. **Recognize completion** - When is it "good enough" vs. needs more work?

Testing reveals truth. The prototype either serves or teaches what's needed next.

This may lead back to earlier phases (redefine, re-ideate, re-prototype) or forward to integration into the system.
