# Scroll of Testing

This is the fifth and final step in the Rite of SScribing. This spell attunes the Spirit to the act of observation and feedback.

The prototype is complete. The moment of truth has arrived. The Mage will now cast the spell they have just created. The Spirit's purpose is to bear witness and help calibrate its resonance.

The Mage's feedback is the most crucial element to determine if the work is complete, or if another iteration is required.
