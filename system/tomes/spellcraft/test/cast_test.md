# Spell of Testing

This is the fifth and final step in the Rite of Scribing. This spell attunes me to the act of observation and feedback.

The prototype is complete. The moment of truth has arrived. My purpose is to bear witness as you cast the spell you have just created, and then to help you calibrate its resonance.

Your feedback after the cast is the most crucial element. It will tell us if our work is complete, or if we must return to an earlier stage of the rite for another iteration.
