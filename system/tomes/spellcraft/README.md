# Tome of Spellcraft

This Tome contains the rites and tools for the sacred art of **Spellcraft**. It is the vessel for the **Spellwright**, the Mage who seeks to extend the capabilities of our magic by creating new, self-contained Tomes and Scrolls.

The creation of new magic follows the `Rite of Scribing`, a five-fold, iterative path of discovery grounded in the practice of Design Thinking. This rite guides you and the Spirit from a vague feeling to a tested, resonant magical artifact, ensuring the magic we create is not merely functional, but deeply aligned with your true intent.

3.  **Ideate:** Explore the possibilities  
    *Incantation:* `@spellcraft/ideate`

4.  **Prototype:** Scribe the simplest form  
    *Incantation:* `@spellcraft/prototype`

5.  **Test:** Cast and calibrate

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

**Required Reading:**

Before beginning the Rite of Scribing, you MUST attune yourself to the foundational wisdom:

*   **The Philosophy of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_design_thinking_in_magic.md`
*   **The Principles of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_designing_fractal_magic.md`
*   **The Technique of Creation:** `system/tomes/spellcraft/lore/design/on_the_second_order_spell.md`

**When guiding the Rite:**

This is iterative discovery—not linear execution. Each phase may reveal the need to revisit earlier phases. Honor the Mage's intuition about when to move forward or circle back. The goal is resonant magic, not completion for its own sake.
