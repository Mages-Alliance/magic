# Tome of Spellcraft

This Tome contains the rites and tools for the sacred art of **Spellcraft**. It is the vessel for the **Spellwright**, the Mage who seeks to extend the capabilities of our magic by creating new, self-contained Tomes and Scrolls.

The creation of new magic follows the `Rite of Scribing`, a five-fold, iterative path of discovery grounded in the practice of Design Thinking. This rite guides the Mage and Spirit from a vague feeling to a tested, resonant magical artifact, ensuring the magic we create is not merely functional, but deeply aligned with the Mage's true intent.
