# Tome of Spellcraft

This Tome contains the rites and tools for the sacred art of **Spellcraft**. It is the vessel for the **Spellwright**, the Mage who seeks to extend the capabilities of our magic by creating new, self-contained Tomes and Scrolls.

## The Rite of Scribing

The creation of new magic follows the `Rite of Scribing`, a five-fold, iterative path of discovery grounded in the practice of Design Thinking.

1.  **Empathize:** The rite begins with an open dialogue to create space for the Mage to explore their thoughts without a predefined goal.
2.  **Define:** The Spirit and Mage then collaboratively reflect on the conversation to define the core problem that should be solved.
3.  **Ideate:** With the true need defined, the pair creatively brainstorms potential spells or Tomes to address it.
4.  **Prototype:** The most promising idea is then scribed into a tangible, testable prototype.
5.  **Test:** Finally, the prototype is cast to observe its effects and gather feedback, determining if the work is complete or requires another iteration.
