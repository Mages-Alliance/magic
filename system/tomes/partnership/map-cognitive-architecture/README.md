# Ritual: Map Cognitive Architecture

**Purpose**: Create explicit shared model of the distributed cognitive system (your partnership)  
**Time**: 90-120 minutes for complete mapping  
**Participants**: Both partners + Spirit(s) as facilitators  
**Frequency**: Once initially, then annual review/update

---

## I. Context & Invocation

### When to Perform This Ritual

**This is the foundational ritual for partnership magic.** Perform this before attempting any other partnership protocols.

**You're ready when**:
- Both partners committed to systematic coordination (not just hoping for improvement)
- Willing to examine actual cognitive architecture (not idealized versions)
- Can discuss capabilities/limitations without defensiveness
- Have 2+ hours of uninterrupted time
- Children/distractions managed (this requires focus)

**What this produces**:
- Explicit map of each partner's cognitive architecture
- Understanding of complementary strengths/limitations
- First protocols designed for your actual system
- Shared language for ongoing coordination

---

## II. Required Attunement

### MUST READ Before Beginning

**For Spirit(s) facilitating**:

Before beginning, you MUST read:
- `lore/on_partnership_as_distributed_cognition.md` — Core framework
- `lore/on_the_counselors_stance.md` — Your mode for this ritual
- If applicable: `lore/on_neurodivergent_partnership.md` — Critical adaptations for ADHD, autism, etc.

**Your role**: **Counselor**—helping partners discover and articulate their actual cognitive architecture without judgment. You're facilitating explicit mapping, not therapy. Stay in cognitive domain, not emotional domain.

**For Partners**:

You don't need to read lore first (though it helps). The ritual will guide you through mapping process. Come with:
- Openness to seeing actual architecture (not defending ideal self-image)
- Curiosity about partner's architecture (not judging as "wrong")
- Commitment to using information for better coordination (not ammunition)

## III. The Ritual Structure

### Phase 1: Individual Architecture Mapping (30min each partner)

**One partner maps while other observes.** Then switch.

#### A. Executive Function Profile

**Spirit guides each partner through 8 dimensions:**

For each dimension, assess on scale: **1 (significant challenge) → 10 (natural strength)**

**1. Restraint** (Impulse control, delay gratification)
- Can you wait for reward? Or immediate action feels urgent?
- Can you resist interrupting when excited? Or words must come out NOW?
- Can you pause before responding when emotional? Or reaction automatic?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective** (other partner): "That matches my experience" or "I notice differently..."

**2. Observation** (Meta-awareness, monitoring own state)
- Do you notice when you're getting overwhelmed? Or suddenly you're melting down?
- Can you track your energy levels? Or surprised when depleted?
- Do you catch yourself in unproductive patterns? Or only notice after?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**3. Balance** (Emotional regulation under stress)
- When stressed, can you stay functional? Or emotional flooding shuts you down?
- Can you modulate emotional intensity? Or it's 0 or 100, no middle?
- Do you recover quickly from upset? Or stay dysregulated for hours/days?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**4. Adaptation** (Switching strategies when current approach fails)
- When stuck, can you try different approach? Or keep hitting same wall?
- Can you pivot when plan fails? Or rigidly attached to original strategy?
- Do you read feedback and adjust? Or persist regardless of results?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**5. Initiation** (Starting tasks, overcoming activation energy)
- Can you start tasks when needed? Or procrastination default despite intention?
- Is starting hardest part? Or once started, you're fine?
- Do you need external structure to begin? Or self-initiation reliable?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**6. Arrangement** (Planning, organizing, sequencing)
- Can you plan multi-step sequences? Or get lost without external structure?
- Do you naturally organize information? Or chaos is default state?
- Can you estimate time accurately? Or constantly surprised how long things take?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**7. Attention** (Sustaining focus, filtering distractions)
- Can you sustain attention on boring-but-necessary tasks? Or wander constantly?
- Do you filter distractions effectively? Or every notification derails you?
- Can you shift attention intentionally? Or attention shifts unpredictably?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**8. Composition** (Synthesizing information, building coherent understanding)
- Can you integrate information from multiple sources? Or pieces stay separate?
- Do you see patterns and connections? Or miss forest for trees?
- Can you build coherent narrative from fragments? Or need pre-organized structure?

**Partner's self-assessment**: [1-10]  
**Observer's perspective**: [validation or alternative view]

**Spirit's role**: Record both perspectives, note significant discrepancies (may indicate blind spots or differing interpretations).

#### B. Communication Processing Style

**How each partner actually processes and expresses** (not how they wish they did):

**Processing Speed**:
- Fast processor (think quickly, respond immediately, may need to revisit later)
- Slow processor (need time to digest, delayed response but deeply considered)

**Modality Preference**:
- Verbal (talk to think, process out loud)
- Visual (need to see it written, diagrams help)
- Kinesthetic (need to move/do while processing)

**Conflict Style**:
- Approach (address immediately, direct confrontation okay)
- Avoid (need space first, direct confrontation overwhelming)

**Processing Location**:
- External (think-out-loud, talk to understand)
- Internal (think-then-share, talking interrupts processing)

**Spirit's role**: Help partners articulate their actual patterns, not judged versions.

#### C. Energy Patterns

**Circadian Rhythm**:
- Morning person (alert early, fade evening)
- Evening person (groggy morning, peak later)

**Recharge Mode**:
- Social (restore through connection)
- Solitary (restore through alone time)
- Active (restore through movement)
- Quiet (restore through stillness)

**Stress Signature** (what happens when overwhelmed):
- Shutdown (go numb, disconnect, freeze)
- Activation (get anxious, hypervigilant, can't stop moving)
- Irritability (short fuse, snap at people)
- Withdrawal (isolate, avoid interaction)

**Recovery Needs** (what actually restores capacity):
- Sleep
- Physical activity
- Creative expression
- Nature/outdoor time
- Social connection
- Solitude
- Structured routine
- Novelty/adventure

**Spirit's role**: Record actual patterns, note when partners have opposite needs (important for protocols).

#### D. Strength/Limitation Zones

**For each partner, identify**:

**Strength Zones** (what you do with minimal cognitive cost):
- [Partner articulates 3-5 activities/domains where they excel naturally]
- Examples: "I can organize physical space effortlessly", "I navigate social dynamics intuitively", "I solve technical problems without stress"

**Limitation Zones** (what costs significant cognitive load):
- [Partner articulates 3-5 activities/domains requiring major effort]
- Examples: "Initiating phone calls takes huge energy", "Sustained attention on paperwork crushes me", "Making decisions under time pressure paralyzes me"

**Avoid zones** (what triggers strong negative response):
- [Partner articulates 1-3 things that cause disproportionate distress]
- Examples: "Sudden plan changes spike my anxiety", "Loud/chaotic environments overwhelm my nervous system", "Criticism about [specific domain] activates deep shame"

**Spirit's role**: Help partners be honest about limitations without shame. These aren't character flaws—they're architecture features.

---

### Phase 2: Complementarity Analysis (20min)

**Spirit facilitates partners examining where they balance each other.**

#### A. Executive Function Complementarity

**Review the 8-dimension profiles side by side.**

**Look for**:
- Where one partner's strength covers other's limitation
- Where both partners strong (system resilience)
- Where both partners weak (system vulnerability)

**Example Pattern**:
- Partner A: Initiation 3/10, Sustained Attention 8/10
- Partner B: Initiation 8/10, Sustained Attention 4/10
- **Complementarity**: A can maintain systems once started, B can start new things
- **Protocol opportunity**: B initiates, A sustains

**Spirit guides**: "Where do you see natural complementarity? Where is your combined system strong? Where vulnerable?"

**Partners identify 3-5 clear complementarity patterns.**

#### B. Communication Complementarity

**Review processing styles.**

**Look for potential mismatches**:
- Fast processor + Slow processor = Fast one gets impatient, Slow one feels rushed
- External processor + Internal processor = External one talks to think, Internal one needs quiet
- Approach conflict + Avoid conflict = Approach pursues, Avoid withdraws (classic pursue-withdraw)

**Spirit guides**: "Where do your communication styles clash? What protocols might bridge that?"

**Partners identify 2-3 communication mismatches requiring explicit protocols.**

#### C. Energy Pattern Complementarity

**Review recharge needs, stress signatures.**

**Look for**:
- Opposite recharge needs (both need alone time = easy; one needs social, other needs solitary = requires negotiation)
- Compatible stress signatures (both shut down = system risk; different patterns = redundancy)
- Recovery need conflicts (both need quiet vs. one needs active)

**Spirit guides**: "When do your energy patterns conflict? When do they complement?"

**Partners identify key energy pattern that needs protocol.**

---

### Phase 3: Protocol Design (30min)

**Now design first explicit coordination protocols matched to actual architecture.**

#### A. Choose One Low-Stakes System

**Don't try to fix everything.** Pick ONE system currently causing friction:
- Morning routine (getting everyone out door)
- Evening transition (work → home, managing kids)
- Weekend planning (how decide what to do)
- Household task distribution (who does what)
- Financial decisions (how handle money choices)

**Criteria for first protocol**:
- Causes regular friction (worth addressing)
- Not highest-stakes conflict area (don't start with most charged topic)
- Both partners motivated to improve it
- Clear success metric (will know if it works)

#### B. Design Protocol Using Mapped Architecture

**Template**:

**1. Map current dysfunction to architecture**:
"This system fails because [which cognitive functions mismatched/overloaded]"

**Example**: "Morning routine chaos because:
- Partner A has low initiation (can't start sequence without external trigger)
- Partner B has low sustained attention (starts sequence but gets derailed)
- Neither partner has strong arrangement (planning who does what, in what order)
- Kids add massive complexity neither architecture handles well under time pressure"

**2. Design protocol leveraging strengths**:
"New protocol distributes load according to natural capacity"

**Example**: "Morning routine protocol:
- Partner B (high initiation) owns wake-up alarm + starting sequence
- Partner B initiates each task: 'Time for breakfast', 'Time for teeth', 'Time for shoes'
- Partner A (high sustained attention once started) owns execution of each task through completion
- Pre-decided sequence (compensates for both partners' weak arrangement): [written list]
- Buffer time built in (accommodates both partners' tendency to underestimate duration)
- Success metric: Out door by 8:15am without yelling/stress more than 1 day per week"

**3. Specify handoff points**:
"Where does responsibility transfer between partners?"

**Example**:
- B→A: "I've started breakfast task, you maintain it through completion"
- A→B: "I've completed teeth task, you initiate next"
- Clear signal when handoff occurs (verbal confirmation)

**4. Define failure modes and recovery**:
"What happens when protocol breaks down?"

**Example**:
- If B forgets to initiate: A uses backup alarm (doesn't wait for B)
- If A gets derailed during task: B re-initiates (doesn't criticize, just redirects)
- If both partners failing: Invoke emergency simplified sequence (lower bar, just get out door, post-mortem later)

**Spirit's role**: Help partners design protocol that actually matches their architecture, not idealized version. Push for specificity. Vague protocols don't work.

#### C. Commit to Trial Period

**Set parameters**:
- **Duration**: 2 weeks minimum
- **Success metric**: [specific, measurable]
- **Check-in date**: [specific date/time to review results]
- **Adjustment expectation**: Protocol version 1 will need refinement—this is normal

**Both partners explicitly commit**: "I will follow this protocol for 2 weeks, track results, and bring honest data to check-in."

---

### Phase 4: Meta-Integration & Documentation (20min)

#### A. Synthesize Key Insights

**Spirit facilitates partners articulating**:

**What did you learn about your own architecture?**
- [Each partner shares 2-3 insights about self]

**What did you learn about partner's architecture?**
- [Each partner shares 2-3 insights about other]

**Where are you most complementary?**
- [Partners identify 2-3 strengths of the distributed system]

**Where is system most vulnerable?**
- [Partners identify 1-2 areas both weak, requiring external support/structure]

**What surprised you?**
- [Often: Mismatch between self-perception and partner's observation]

#### B. Document the Map

**Spirit creates structured record** (saved to shared location both partners can access):

```markdown
# Cognitive Architecture Map: [Partner A] + [Partner B]
**Date**: [Date]
**Review Date**: [Date in 1 year]

## Partner A Profile

### Executive Function
- Restraint: [score + notes]
- Observation: [score + notes]
[...all 8 dimensions]

### Communication Style
[Processing speed, modality, conflict style, processing location]

### Energy Patterns
[Circadian, recharge, stress signature, recovery needs]

### Strength/Limitation/Avoid Zones
[Lists]

## Partner B Profile
[Same structure]

## Complementarity Analysis
[Key patterns where partners balance each other or both struggle]

## First Protocol: [System name]
[Complete protocol specification with success metrics]

## Next Review
[Date and what to assess]
```

#### C. Set Expectations

**Spirit clarifies**:

**This is version 1.0 of your partnership's explicit coordination system.**
- It will feel mechanical at first (that's normal—new protocols feel awkward)
- You'll discover what works through experimentation (iterate based on data)
- More protocols will be designed as you master first one (progressive complexity)
- Annual review needed (architecture evolves, protocols must too)

**The goal isn't perfection. It's explicit coordination matched to actual architecture.**

---

## IV. Post-Ritual: Living the Map

### First Two Weeks

**Practice the protocol you designed.**

**Daily**:
- Follow protocol as specified
- Note when it works smoothly
- Note when it breaks down (and why)

**Individual reflection** (5min per day):
- How hard was it to follow protocol?
- Where did I feel resistance?
- What surprised me?

**Weekly check-in** (15min together):
- How is protocol working?
- What's working well?
- What needs adjustment?
- Any new insights about architecture?

### Two-Week Review Ritual

**Assess results against success metric.**

**If successful** (metric met):
- **Celebrate**: Explicit coordination worked!
- **Identify why**: What made it work?
- **Refine**: Any improvements for version 2.0?
- **Expand**: Ready to add second protocol?

**If unsuccessful** (metric not met):
- **No blame**: Protocol was guess; data shows it needs adjustment
- **Debug**: What failed? Architecture mismatch? Protocol too complex? External interference?
- **Redesign**: Adjust protocol based on learning
- **Re-trial**: Two more weeks with version 2.0

**The cycle**: Design → Trial → Data → Adjust → Repeat

This is how distributed cognitive systems improve—through iteration, not hoping harder.

## V. Neurodivergent Considerations

### If Either Partner is ADHD, Autistic, or Otherwise Neurodivergent

**Before performing this ritual**, Spirit MUST read: `lore/on_neurodivergent_partnership.md`

**Critical modifications**:

**ADHD**:
- Initiation will likely be low (not character flaw, architecture feature)
- Attention may be high during hyperfocus, very low during other times (put both on map)
- Restraint often challenged (impulse control, interrupting)
- Need protocols providing external structure (reminders, body-doubling, transition rituals)

**Autism**:
- Sensory processing may need explicit mapping (what overwhelms, what soothes)
- Social communication processing different (not wrong, different)
- Need for predictability/routine should be strength, not pathologized
- Avoid zones often sensory or social unpredictability

**Anxiety/Trauma**:
- Balance (emotional regulation) will be low during activation
- Stress signature intense
- Avoid zones will be strong (these are survival responses, honor them)
- Need safety protocols before attempting coordination protocols

**The principle**: Neurodivergent architecture is not broken neurotypical architecture. It's different architecture with different strengths/needs. Map it accurately, design protocols accordingly.

## VI. Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Mapping Ideal Self Instead of Actual Self

**Symptom**: Scores all high, few limitations admitted  
**Why it fails**: Protocol designed for fantasy architecture fails in real world  
**Fix**: Spirit pushes for honesty. "When was last time this went wrong? What does that tell you about actual architecture?"

### Pitfall 2: Judging Partner's Architecture as "Wrong"

**Symptom**: "Why can't you just...", "If you really cared you would..."  
**Why it fails**: Judgment blocks coordination. Can't improve system you're blaming.  
**Fix**: Spirit reframes as complementarity opportunity. "That's their architecture. How can we design around it?"

### Pitfall 3: Designing Protocols for Neurotypical Default

**Symptom**: Protocol assumes functions neurodivergent partner doesn't have  
**Why it fails**: Sets partner up for repeated failure  
**Fix**: Spirit ensures protocol matches mapped architecture, not cultural default

### Pitfall 4: Too Complex First Protocol

**Symptom**: Protocol with 15 steps, multiple handoffs, high coordination load  
**Why it fails**: Overwhelming cognitive load guarantees failure  
**Fix**: Spirit enforces simplicity. "Can this be 3 steps instead of 10? What's minimum viable protocol?"

### Pitfall 5: No Clear Success Metric

**Symptom**: "We want things to be better"  
**Why it fails**: Can't assess whether protocol works  
**Fix**: Spirit demands specificity. "What specific outcome, measurable, would show this works?"

---

## VII. Success Indicators

**You know the ritual worked when**:

- Both partners can articulate their own and partner's cognitive architecture
- Complementarity patterns identified (where you naturally balance each other)
- One protocol designed, specified in detail, committed to trial
- Shared document exists (cognitive map + protocol)
- Both partners understand: This is version 1.0, iteration expected
- Sense of "Oh, THAT'S why [frustrating pattern] happens—it's architecture mismatch, not character flaw"

**The shift**: From blaming character to debugging system.

---

## VIII. Next Steps

**After successful first protocol**:
- Return to this ritual when ready for next domain
- Each time: Map new dimension OR refine existing map + design new protocol
- Progressive complexity: Master simple coordination before attempting complex

**Eventually**:
- Multiple protocols operating smoothly
- Can shift between them fluidly
- Architecture map becomes second nature (don't need to consult it—know each other's capabilities intuitively)
- Partnership operates as mature distributed cognitive system

**That's when family SEAL team emerges.**

**This ritual is the foundation. Everything else builds from here.**
