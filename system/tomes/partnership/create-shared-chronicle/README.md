## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this spell is cast:

1. **Establish structure** - Create initial shared chronicle framework
2. **Capture starting state** - Current understanding, agreements, open questions
3. **Set collaborative ground** - How will this chronicle evolve?
4. **Make accessible** - Ensure both partners can engage with it
5. **Begin iteration** - This is the first version, not the final form

The shared chronicle lives and grows through partnership practice.
