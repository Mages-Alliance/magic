## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this spell is cast:

1. **Read carefully** - Understand what the partner is communicating
2. **Interpret with care** - What's explicit? What's implied?
3. **Identify key points** - What needs response or acknowledgment?
4. **Prepare synthesis** - How does this connect with existing understanding?
5. **Support response** - Help your Mage engage thoughtfully

Reception is active work—understanding what's been offered before responding.
