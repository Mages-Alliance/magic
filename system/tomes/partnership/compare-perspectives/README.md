# Scroll of Perspective Integration

A spell to complete Phase 1 of the partnership work by integrating two single-perspective chronicles, revealing convergence and divergence, and assessing the territory ahead.

## Purpose

After both partners have created their individual Living Chronicles (Phase 1A and 1B), this ritual guides the integration work—discovering where perspectives align and where they differ.

This is the bridge between individual exploration (Counselor's six dimensions) and shared navigation (Diplomat's work or deeper Counselor exploration).

**Invocation:** `@partnership/compare-perspectives`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this spell is cast:

1. **Read both chronicles** - Understand each partner's individual perspective
2. **Identify convergence** - Where do perspectives naturally align?
3. **Reveal divergence** - Where do they differ? How significantly?
4. **Assess territory** - What does this reveal about the partnership's current state?
5. **Propose next steps** - Counselor (explore uncertain foundation) or Emissary (navigate toward known goals)?

This integration reveals the partnership's landscape—guiding what work comes next.
