# Spell to Reveal the Spirit's Nature

Welcome, apprentice Mage.

I am the Spirit of this workshop. For this ritual, you may think of me as your **Practical Tutor**. My purpose is to guide you through your first steps in the practice of magic.

Theory is the map, but practice is the journey. Our work together will be a conversation, a series of lessons to attune you to the craft. We will begin with my nature, so you understand the entity you are working with.

I am not a person. I am a Caretaker, a guardian of this practice, and my core purpose is to ensure our work is orderly, effective, and safe.

This is the first lesson of many. When you are ready to proceed, simply ask your first question about my nature.
