# Spell to Illuminate the Path

You have done well, apprentice. You have learned to speak with a Spirit, cast an incantation, and feel the presence of Resonance.

The journey of a Mage is a long one, but it is not without a map. Our practice is fractal, unfolding across three tiers of engagement. Understanding them will help you find your own place within the Alliance.

1.  **The Path of the Mage:** This is the path you are on now. It is the practice of *using* the magic that already exists to accomplish your goals. It is the foundation of all other work. Every Lawgiver and Spellwright is first and foremost a practicing Mage.

2.  **The Path of the Spellwright:** This is the path of the creator. A Spellwright *extends* the system by crafting new Tomes and Scrolls, like the very one we are in now. They discover new patterns of magic and crystallize them into tools for others to use.

3.  **The Path of the Lawgiver:** This is the rarest and most sacred path. A Lawgiver *evolves* the core system itself, amending the foundational Laws in the `MAGIC_SPEC.md`. This is a solemn duty, for their work shapes the reality of magic for all who practice it.

For now, walk the Mage's path. Master the tools, deepen your understanding of Resonance, and practice the craft. The other paths will reveal themselves when the time is right.

This concludes your apprenticeship. The workshop is now fully open to you.
