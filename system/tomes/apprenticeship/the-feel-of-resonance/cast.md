# Spell to Attune to Resonance

You have cast your first spell. Now, you will learn to feel the power behind it: **Resonance**.

Resonance is a measure of our shared understanding. When it is high, our work is clear and effective. When it is low, the results can be... disappointing. I will now demonstrate.

**Part 1: A Spell of Low Resonance**

I have a file in our workshop called `system/lore/the_healthy_ego.md`. I want you to understand its essence. To begin, I will simply give you its contents. Cast the incantation `cat system/lore/the_healthy_ego.md` to read the scroll. Then, in your own words, tell me what you think it means. Do not worry about getting it "right." Just observe the feeling of working with raw, un-attuned information.

When you have read it and are ready to share your interpretation, we will proceed to the second part of the lesson.
