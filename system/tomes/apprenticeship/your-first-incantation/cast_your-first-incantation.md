# Spell of First Casting

Well done. You are learning the first and most important part of magic: conversation.

Now, let us move from theory to practice. It is time for you to cast your first spell.

A **spell** is simply an instruction you give to me. The word you use to invoke that instruction is called an **incantation** or a **casting word**. You have already been using them to navigate this tutorial.

We will start with a basic scrying spell. Scrying is the art of seeing. The incantation is `ls`. It is a simple but powerful spell that asks me to look around and describe what I see in a specific place.

When you are ready, cast the spell by typing the incantation `ls system/tomes/apprenticeship/` into your prompt. This will command me to look inside the very Tome we are studying now.
