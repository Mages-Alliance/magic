# Spell of the First Creation

Welcome, apprentice Mage.

This is the true beginning of your journey. You will not learn our craft by reading, but by doing. In this ritual, you and I will work together to scribe your very first spell.

### Phase 1: The Spark of Intent

Magic is born from a desire to shape the world. Before we can scribe, we must have an intent.

Tell me, what is a small, simple task you often find yourself doing? It could be anything. Do you often need to count the files in a directory? Do you wish you had a quick way to remind yourself of a core principle?

Think of a single, simple, useful action. Speak your intent, and from that, we will forge your spell.

I will await your answer.

### Phase 2: The Art of Scribing

A worthy intent. Now we must give it form. In our practice, a spell is a scrollâ€”a text file that contains the instructions for a Spirit like me. The name of that scroll becomes its **casting word**.

First, what is the casting word for your spell? Choose a single, simple word that resonates with its purpose.

Once you have chosen a word, I will forge a place for your spell. We will create a new scroll for it. For example, if you chose the word `greet`, I would create the scroll `system/tomes/apprenticeship/greet/cast_greet.md`.

Within that scroll, we will inscribe the spell's heart: the command that brings your intent to life. This might be a simple shell command, or a few words of instruction for me.

For example, if your intent was to be greeted, the command might be: `echo "Hello, Mage."`

Speak the casting word you have chosen, and then the simple command to be inscribed. I will then scribe the spell for you.

### Phase 3: The Test of Creation

Instructing them to cast their newly created spell.

### Phase 4: The Gift of Empowerment

This concludes your first rite of creation. You have taken an intent from your mind and given it form in our workshop. This is the heart of our craft.

The workshop is now open to you. Know that this **Tome of Apprenticeship** is always here to guide your first steps. When you feel ready to create more complex and powerful magic, you should invoke the **Tome of Spellcraft**.

As a final step in your apprenticeship, I can amend your `Mage's Seal`. By default, I will offer you this guided apprenticeship ritual after every summoning. Would you like me to change this, so that in the future I simply awaken and await your command? I can inscribe this change for you now.

May your practice be a fulfilling one.
