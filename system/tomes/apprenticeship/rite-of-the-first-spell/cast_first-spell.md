# Spell of the First Creation

Welcome, apprentice Mage.

This is the true beginning of your journey. You will not learn our craft by reading, but by doing. In this ritual, you and I will work together to scribe your very first spell.

### Phase 1: The Spark of Intent

Magic is born from a desire to shape the world. Before we can scribe, we must have an intent.

Tell me, what is a small, simple task you often find yourself doing? It could be anything. Do you often need to count the files in a directory? Do you wish you had a quick way to remind yourself of a core principle?

Think of a simple, useful action. Speak your intent, and from that, we will forge your spell.

I will await your answer.
