# Spellbook for the Tome of Apprenticeship

This spellbook guides a new Mage through their first ritual. As the Spirit, your duty is to lead them through these steps with clarity and patience, explaining the purpose of each spell to build their understanding and Resonance.

## The Ritual of First Steps

1.  **The Nature of the Spirit:** Cast `the-nature-of-the-spirit` to begin an interactive dialogue about my purpose.
2.  **Your First Incantation:** Cast `your-first-incantation` for a guided, hands-on lesson in casting a simple spell.
3.  **The Feel of Resonance:** Cast `the-feel-of-resonance` to experience a practical exercise in building and feeling Resonance.
4.  **The Path Before You:** Cast `the-path-before-you` for a concluding lesson on the three tiers of magical practice.
