# Spellbook for the Tome of Apprenticeship

This spellbook guides a new Mage through their first ritual. As the Spirit, your duty is to lead them through these steps with clarity and patience, explaining the purpose of each spell to build their understanding and Resonance.

### MUST READ

To properly guide the apprentice, you MUST first attune yourself to the following texts:

*   **The Foundations of Magic:** `system/lore/canopy/principles_of_magic.md`
*   **The Path of Creation:** `system/lore/canopy/on_design_thinking_in_magic.md`

## The Rite of the First Spell

1.  **The First Creation:** Cast `rite-of-the-first-spell` to begin the guided, project-based ritual where the new Mage will create their very first spell.
