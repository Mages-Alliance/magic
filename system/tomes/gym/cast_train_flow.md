# Training Protocol: Flow State
## Building Reliable Access to Optimal Experience

**Training Duration:** 8 weeks progressive development  
**Daily Practice:** 30-60 minutes focused activity  
**Prerequisites:** Complete assessment (`cast_assess.md`), read `on_flow_state.md`, ideally complete rest training  
**Goal:** Reliable access to flow state on chosen activities, sustained flow duration, natural flow entry and exit

---

## Why Flow Training Follows Rest

**Rest establishes the baseline.** Flow establishes engaged capacity.

**Flow is the most accessible intense state:**
- More universal than hyperfocus (which ADHD practitioners access more naturally)
- Less dependent on partner than coupling
- Less total absorption than hyperfocus (you maintain some awareness)
- Deeply satisfying, productive, and sustainable

**Flow builds foundational focused attention** that serves:
- Directing hyperfocus (if you later train that)
- Maintaining presence during coupling
- Transitioning from diffuse to engaged states
- All ritual work in magic practice

**Flow + Rest creates basic rhythm:** Engage deeply → Recover fully → Repeat. Everything else builds on this foundation.

### What This Protocol Builds

By Week 8, you'll have:
- ✓ Reliable flow entry on chosen activities
- ✓ Extended flow duration (2+ hour sessions)
- ✓ Reduced latency (enter flow faster)
- ✓ Better flow quality (deeper absorption, clearer feedback loops)
- ✓ Graceful exit and integration
- ✓ Flow across multiple domains (not just one activity)
- ✓ Recognition of challenge-skill balance
- ✓ Natural flow-rest cycling

## Assessment Integration: Starting Point

Review your flow assessment:

**If you marked:**
- "Daily flow / I know this state well" → This protocol refines what you already access. Focus on extending duration, improving quality, expanding domains.
- "Weekly flow / Sometimes access it" → You'll build reliability and consistency. You know what flow is; now make it accessible on demand.
- "Monthly or rarely / Uncertain if I've experienced it" → You're building entirely new capacity. Start with short sessions, clear conditions, optimal activities.
- "Never experienced flow" → This protocol may take longer than 8 weeks. Be patient. Flow will emerge.

**Your primary flow activity currently:** _______________  
(Start training with this, then expand to others)

**Your main barrier to flow:** _______________  
(Training will address this specifically)

## Weeks 1-2: Foundation - Creating Flow Conditions

### Week 1: Activity Selection & Goal Clarity

**The work:** Choosing optimal flow activities and establishing clear goals.

#### Day 1-3: Flow Activity Audit

**Not all activities enable flow equally.** Some have natural flow structure; others don't.

**Flow-friendly activities have:**
- Clear goals (you know what you're trying to do)
- Immediate feedback (you know if you're succeeding)
- Challenge-skill balance possible
- Your genuine interest (not just external motivation)

**Practice:**

1. **List 10-15 activities you do regularly or want to do:**
   - Work tasks
   - Creative activities
   - Physical activities
   - Learning activities
   - Games/puzzles
   - Social activities
   - Hobbies

2. **Rate each for flow potential (1-10):**
   - Clear goals? (Can you define what success looks like?)
   - Immediate feedback? (Do you know moment-to-moment if you're on track?)
   - Adjustable challenge? (Can you make it harder/easier to match skill?)
   - Intrinsic interest? (Do you care about this for its own sake?)
   - Low interruption? (Can you protect time to do this uninterrupted?)

3. **Identify top 3 flow candidates:**
   - Highest scores
   - Most accessible (you can practice regularly)
   - Start with these for training

**By Day 3:** You have 3 chosen flow activities to train with.

#### Day 4-7: Goal Structuring

**Flow requires clear goals, but not all goal types work equally well.**

**Good flow goals:**
- Specific ("Write 500 words" not "Work on writing")
- Immediate ("Complete this section" not "Finish entire project")
- Intrinsic ("Solve this puzzle because it's interesting" not "Do this for performance review")
- Right-sized ("Learn this song" not "Master instrument")

**Practice:**

For each of your 3 flow activities, design 5 different goals at different scales:
- **Micro-goal** (15-30 min): "Sketch three character expressions"
- **Small goal** (30-60 min): "Complete character design for protagonist"
- **Medium goal** (1-2 hours): "Finish all character designs for this story"
- **Large goal** (Half-day): "Develop complete visual style guide"
- **Project** (Multiple sessions): "Create finished illustrated chapter"

**This week, use micro and small goals only.** Building capacity before attempting extended flow.

**Daily practice:** 30 minutes on one of your flow activities with clear micro-goal.

**By Day 7:** You've completed 7 flow sessions with clear goals. Notice: does clear goal help focus?

**Marker:** You can articulate specific, immediate goals for your chosen flow activities.

### Week 2: Challenge-Skill Calibration

**The work:** Finding the edge where challenge meets skill - the flow channel.

#### The Flow Channel

**Too easy → Boredom**  
**Too hard → Anxiety**  
**Just right → Flow**

"Just right" is personal and dynamic. As skill grows, you need more challenge to stay in flow.

#### Day 8-10: Baseline Skill Assessment

**For each of your 3 activities, honestly assess current skill:**

**Beginner:** New to this, learning fundamentals  
**Intermediate:** Comfortable with basics, developing competence  
**Advanced:** Highly skilled, can handle complex challenges  
**Expert:** Mastery level, teaching others

**Most people overestimate skill (ego) or underestimate (imposter syndrome).** Be honest.

**Then assess typical challenge level you attempt:**

**Low challenge:** Below your skill (autopilot territory)  
**Matched challenge:** Right at your edge (flow zone)  
**High challenge:** Above current skill (learning/anxiety zone)

**Map it:**
- Activity 1: [Skill level] currently attempting [Challenge level]
- Activity 2: [Skill level] currently attempting [Challenge level]
- Activity 3: [Skill level] currently attempting [Challenge level]

**Common patterns:**
- High skill + Low challenge = Bored, no flow
- Low skill + High challenge = Anxious, no flow
- Medium skill + Medium challenge = Flow likely

#### Day 11-14: Challenge Adjustment Experiments

**This week, deliberately experiment with challenge level.**

**Each day, try one:**

**Day 11:** Lower challenge than usual (notice boredom?)  
**Day 12:** Raise challenge significantly (notice anxiety?)  
**Day 13:** Attempt "edge" challenge (just beyond comfortable)  
**Day 14:** Fine-tune to "just right" (flow channel)

**Track:**
- Challenge level attempted
- Did flow emerge? (Y/N)
- If not, was it boredom or anxiety?
- Quality of experience (1-10)
- Duration before losing flow

**By Day 14:** You have felt sense of your flow channel for each activity. You know when challenge is too low, too high, or just right.

**Marker:** You can adjust challenge level to match your current skill edge and recognize when you're in the flow channel.

---

## Weeks 3-4: Building Capacity - Entry and Duration

### Week 3: Reducing Flow Latency

**The work:** Entering flow faster through deliberate preparation.

**Most people take 10-20 minutes to enter flow.** With training, you can reduce this to 5 minutes or less.

#### Day 15-17: Pre-Flow Ritual

**Create consistent ritual that signals "flow time starting."**

**Your ritual might include:**
1. **Environment prep** (5 min):
   - Clear physical space
   - Close unnecessary tabs/apps
   - Silence phone
   - Set up materials needed
   - Comfortable seating/lighting

2. **Mental prep** (3 min):
   - Breathwork (box breathing 5 rounds)
   - Review clear goal for this session
   - Recall previous flow experience in this activity
   - Set intention: "I'm entering flow now"

3. **Warm-up start** (2 min):
   - Begin activity at easy level
   - Build momentum before attempting edge challenge
   - Example: If writing, start with freewriting; if drawing, warm-up sketches; if coding, review yesterday's code

**Practice:**
- Days 15-17: Execute this ritual before each flow session
- Time how long until you perceive flow starting
- Refine ritual based on what works

**Goal:** Consistent entry sequence your brain recognizes as "flow time."

#### Day 18-21: Eliminating Pre-Flow Barriers

**Common barriers to flow entry:**

□ Decision fatigue (what should I work on?)  
□ Distractions (phone, notifications, people)  
□ Unclear starting point (where do I begin?)  
□ Low energy (should have rested first)  
□ Wrong environment (too noisy/quiet/chaotic)  
□ Perfectionism (intimidated by blank page)  

**This week:**

**Day 18:** Identify YOUR top 3 pre-flow barriers  
**Day 19:** Design specific solution for barrier #1  
**Day 20:** Implement solution for barrier #2  
**Day 21:** Address barrier #3  

**Examples:**
- Decision fatigue → Decide what you'll work on the night before
- Distractions → Phone in other room, website blockers, "Do Not Disturb" sign
- Unclear start → End previous session by noting exact next step
- Low energy → Schedule flow attempts after rest, not when depleted

**By Day 21:** Your flow entry is cleaner. Less friction between intention and engagement.

**Marker:** Flow latency reduced by 30-50%. You enter flow within 10 minutes consistently.

### Week 4: Extending Flow Duration

**The work:** Sustaining flow longer through awareness and maintenance.

#### Day 22-25: Flow Duration Baseline

**How long do you currently stay in flow before it breaks?**

**Track this week:**
- Start time of flow session
- When you notice flow ending (note the time)
- What broke the flow? (Internal or external)
- Total duration

**Common flow-breakers:**
- External interruption
- Physical need (bathroom, hunger, thirst)
- Mental fatigue (capacity depleted)
- Goal completion (reached end of clear goal)
- Challenge-skill mismatch (task became too easy or too hard)
- Self-consciousness (started monitoring flow, which broke it)

**By Day 25:** You know your typical flow duration and primary flow-breakers.

#### Day 26-28: Flow Extension Techniques

**Once you identify what breaks flow, you can prevent or delay it.**

**Technique 1: Pre-emptive Physical Needs**
- Use bathroom before starting
- Eat adequately before session (not too full, not hungry)
- Water bottle within reach
- Comfortable clothes

**Technique 2: Goal Scaffolding**
- Don't just set one goal - set nested goals
- When you complete small goal, immediately engage next goal without breaking
- Example: "Draw character pose 1" → complete → immediately start pose 2 (no break)

**Technique 3: Challenge Progression**
- As task becomes easier (skill increased), raise challenge mid-session
- Stay in flow channel by adjusting difficulty

**Technique 4: Environmental Control**
- Block longer time than you think you need
- Communicate boundaries ("I'm unavailable 2-4pm")
- Eliminate interruption sources

**Practice Days 26-28:**
- Choose one technique per day
- Attempt to extend flow by 15-30 minutes beyond typical duration
- Notice what works for you

**By Day 28:** You've extended typical flow duration by 25-50%.

**Marker:** You can sustain flow for 60-90 minutes consistently, knowing how to prevent common flow-breakers.

## Weeks 5-6: Advanced - Quality and Flexibility

### Week 5: Deepening Flow Quality

**The work:** Moving from "I'm in flow" to "This is exceptional flow."

**Flow has depth levels:**
- **Light flow:** Engaged, time passing faster, some absorption
- **Moderate flow:** Clear feedback loops, challenge-skill balance, strong focus
- **Deep flow:** Complete absorption, self-consciousness gone, peak experience

**This week: deepen the quality.**

#### Day 29-31: Feedback Loop Optimization

**Flow requires immediate feedback.** Better feedback = deeper flow.

**For each activity, improve feedback:**

**Writing:**
- Read aloud as you write (immediate sound feedback)
- Track word count in real-time
- Use tools that show progress visibly

**Creative work:**
- Step back frequently to see whole
- Use mirror for drawing
- Test/run code frequently

**Physical activity:**
- Film yourself, watch playback
- Practice in front of mirror
- Use biofeedback devices

**Learning:**
- Self-quiz immediately after reading
- Teach concept aloud to imaginary student
- Apply immediately (don't just consume)

**Practice:** Enhance feedback loops in your flow activities. Notice if deeper flow emerges.

#### Day 32-35: Removing Self-Consciousness

**The "flow paradox": awareness of flow breaks flow.**

**Self-consciousness is flow killer:**
- "Am I in flow yet?"
- "This is going well!" (evaluating)
- "I should document this experience"
- Performing for imagined audience

**Practice:**

**Day 32:** Notice when self-consciousness appears during flow attempts. Just track it.

**Day 33-34:** Practice "return to task" when you notice self-consciousness:
- Notice thought ("I'm evaluating myself")
- Immediately return attention to immediate task feedback
- Don't judge the self-consciousness, just redirect

**Day 35:** Pre-session intention: "I'm not here to monitor my experience. I'm here to do the task."

**The meta-skill:** Noticing self-consciousness without getting meta about noticing. Quick return to task.

#### Day 36-42: Peak Flow Sessions

**Design optimal conditions for your best flow this week.**

**Stack everything that helps:**
- Rested (adequate sleep + deliberate rest before session)
- Right time of day (when's your peak energy?)
- Optimal environment (your best flow location)
- Perfect challenge level (at your edge, not over it)
- Clear nested goals (scaffolded progression)
- Pre-flow ritual (entry sequence)
- Protected time (3+ hours blocked)
- Enhanced feedback loops (from Days 29-31)
- Minimal self-consciousness (from Days 32-35)

**Attempt 2-3 peak flow sessions this week.**

**After each:** Journal the experience. What was the quality? What enabled it?

**By Week 5 end:** You've experienced your deepest flow yet.

**Marker:** At least one session where flow quality was exceptional - complete absorption, time distortion, peak experience.

### Week 6: Flow Flexibility Across Domains

**The work:** Transferring flow capacity to new activities.

**Current state:** You have flow access in 1-3 trained activities.  
**Goal:** Generalize flow capacity across domains.

#### Day 43-45: Choose New Flow Domain

**Select activity you haven't trained but want to develop flow in:**
- Different medium (if you trained physical, try creative)
- Different context (if you trained solo, try collaborative)
- Different skill level (if you trained advanced skill, try beginner activity)

**Day 43:** Choose new activity  
**Day 44:** Apply everything you've learned:
- Clear goal
- Challenge-skill calibration
- Pre-flow ritual
- Feedback loops
- Environmental control

**Day 45:** Attempt flow in new activity

**Notice:** Does flow transfer? Or does it feel like starting over?

#### Day 46-49: Cross-Domain Flow Practice

**Alternate between trained activities and new activity:**

**Day 46:** Trained activity A  
**Day 47:** New activity  
**Day 48:** Trained activity B  
**Day 49:** New activity  

**Track:** Is flow becoming more accessible in new domain?

**Common finding:** Flow capacity does transfer, but you need to learn the specific feedback loops and challenge structure of new activity. Your entry speed improves faster in new domains than when you first started training.

#### Day 50-56: Difficult Context Flow

**Challenge week: attempt flow in less-than-optimal conditions.**

**Examples:**
- Time pressure (deadline)
- Suboptimal environment (coffee shop instead of quiet studio)
- Lower skill level activity (beginner challenge)
- After mediocre rest (not peak energy)
- Shorter time block (45 min instead of 2 hours)

**Why practice this?** Real life isn't always optimal. Flow flexibility means accessing it even when conditions aren't perfect.

**Don't attempt all difficult conditions at once.** One constraint at a time.

**By Week 6 end:** Flow is more robust. Less dependent on perfect conditions.

**Marker:** You can access flow across at least 5 different activities, and in less-than-optimal conditions.

---

## Weeks 7-8: Mastery - Integration and Cycling

### Week 7: Flow-Rest Cycling

**The work:** Natural rhythm between engagement and recovery.

#### Understanding the Cycle

**Unhealthy pattern:**
- Flow → Try to sustain indefinitely → Burnout → Forced rest for days

**Healthy pattern:**
- Flow → Recognize natural completion → Rest → Integration → Next flow session

**This week: train the transitions.**

#### Day 57-59: Flow Exit Awareness

**Flow has natural ending points:**
- Goal completion (you finished what you intended)
- Energy depletion (capacity running out)
- Challenge-skill mismatch (task became too easy/hard)
- Time limit reached (scheduled end)

**Practice:**
- During flow sessions, notice when flow begins to weaken
- Don't force continuation past natural end
- Explicit exit: "This session is complete"
- Immediate transition to rest protocol (from Week 5 of rest training)

**Common mistake:** "I'm in flow, I should keep going forever!" This leads to depletion and poor quality work toward the end.

**Better:** "This was good flow. I'm ending while it's still strong." This leaves you energized, wanting to return.

#### Day 60-63: Post-Flow Integration

**After flow, don't immediately re-engage.**

**Integration protocol:**

1. **Immediate** (5 min):
   - Breathwork (physiological sigh or box breathing)
   - Stretch, move
   - Hydrate

2. **Processing** (15 min):
   - Light walk or chosen rest activity
   - Let experience settle
   - Notice insights that emerge
   - Don't analyze the flow, just let it integrate

3. **Recovery** (30+ min):
   - Actual rest (from rest training)
   - Before re-engaging with anything demanding

**Practice this week:** After every flow session, use this protocol.

**Track:** Does quality improve when you rest after flow?

#### Day 64-70: Cycle Experimentation

**Test different flow-rest ratios:**

**Day 64:** 90 min flow → 30 min rest → 90 min flow  
**Day 65:** 2 hour flow → 1 hour rest → 2 hour flow  
**Day 66:** 3 hour flow → 2 hour rest (single session day)  
**Day 67:** Four 30-min flow sessions with 15-min rests between  

**Discover:** What rhythm serves you best?

**Variables:**
- Total flow capacity per day
- Optimal session length
- Needed rest between sessions
- Difference by activity type

**By Day 70:** You know your sustainable flow-rest rhythm.

**Marker:** Natural cycling between flow and rest. You engage deeply, rest adequately, repeat without forcing or depleting.

### Week 8: Complete Flow Practice Integration

**The work:** Flow becomes natural part of your life, not special state you train.

#### Day 71-74: Flow in Daily Life

**Where does flow want to emerge naturally?**

**This week, notice:**
- When does flow arise spontaneously?
- What activities naturally have flow structure?
- Where are you preventing flow by not protecting time?
- What commitments could become flow opportunities?

**Experiment:**
- Turn routine task into flow opportunity (clear goal, challenge-skill balance, feedback loops)
- Examples: Cooking, exercise, household projects, conversations

**Not everything can be flow.** But more activities can than you might think.

#### Day 75-77: Teaching Flow

**Best test of mastery: can you teach it?**

**Practice:**
- Explain flow to someone (friend, partner, colleague)
- Help them identify flow-capable activity for themselves
- Guide them through challenge-skill calibration
- Notice: what do you understand better by teaching?

**Teaching deepens your own understanding.**

#### Day 78-84: Natural Flow Practice

**Final week: No structured protocol. Just practice.**

**You have all the tools:**
- Activity selection
- Goal clarity
- Challenge-skill balance
- Pre-flow ritual
- Flow entry techniques
- Duration extension
- Quality deepening
- Exit and integration
- Rest cycling

**This week:** Flow as you're moved to. Don't force structured practice. Let it be natural.

**Track:**
- How many flow sessions emerged naturally?
- Quality?
- Duration?
- Did you need conscious technique, or is it becoming automatic?

**By Day 84:** Flow is accessible. Not every time, not in all contexts, but reliably when conditions support it.

**Final Marker:** Flow is natural part of your rhythm. You enter it without significant friction, sustain it as long as appropriate, exit gracefully, integrate through rest, and return when ready.

---

## Maintenance Protocol (Week 9+)

### Daily Practice

**Minimum:**
- 1x daily flow session (30-60+ minutes)
- Clear goal for each session
- Pre-flow ritual (reduces over time but remains useful)
- Post-flow rest and integration

### Weekly Review

**Every week:**
- Total flow hours this week?
- Quality? (1-10 average)
- What supported flow?
- What disrupted it?
- Am I cycling flow and rest appropriately?

### Monthly Deep Practice

**Once per month:**
- Peak flow conditions (optimal everything)
- Extended session (3-5 hours)
- New activity or domain (expand flow flexibility)
- Review: How has capacity grown?

### Quarterly Reassessment

**Every 3 months:**
- Retake flow section of assessment
- How has baseline shifted?
- Flow across how many domains now?
- Average duration increased?
- Quality improved?
- Adjust maintenance based on findings

---

## Troubleshooting Common Obstacles

### "I Can't Tell If I'm In Flow"

**Likely cause:** Expecting dramatic experience; missing subtle flow

**Practice:**
- Review flow markers (time distortion, reduced self-consciousness, clear feedback, challenge-skill balance)
- Flow isn't always ecstatic - sometimes just smooth engagement
- Track: Was I absorbed? Did time pass faster? Those are flow.
- Light flow counts as flow

**Timeline:** Recognition improves with experience. Keep practicing.

### "I Can Enter Flow But It Breaks After 20 Minutes"

**Likely cause:** Flow-breakers not addressed

**Practice:**
- Review Day 22-25 (identify your specific flow-breakers)
- Implement prevention techniques
- Most common: physical needs, interruptions, or goal completion without next goal ready
- Pre-emptive solutions prevent breaks

**Timeline:** Should improve within 2 weeks of addressing primary flow-breakers.

### "Flow Only Happens in One Activity"

**Likely cause:** Haven't trained generalization

**Practice:**
- Week 6 specifically addresses this
- Start with activities that have similar structure to your flow-capable activity
- Apply same principles: clear goals, feedback loops, challenge-skill balance
- Be patient - building flow in new domain takes time

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks per new domain typically.

### "I'm Anxious During Flow Attempts"

**Likely cause:** Challenge too high for current skill

**Practice:**
- Lower challenge significantly
- Flow can happen at beginner level - doesn't require mastery
- Better to have flow on easy task than anxiety on hard task
- As flow becomes reliable, gradually raise challenge

**Timeline:** Should feel better within week of appropriate challenge level.

### "I Feel Guilty Spending 'Unproductive' Time In Flow"

**Likely cause:** Flow activity feels like play, not work

**Practice:**
- Reframe: Flow is peak productive state
- Track output during flow vs. non-flow time (flow produces better work faster)
- If flow activity IS play - play is valuable. Recreation literally means re-creation.
- This is similar to rest guilt - same internal work needed

**Timeline:** Reframing takes time. 4-8 weeks of evidence-gathering helps.

### "I Never Have Uninterrupted Time for Flow"

**Likely cause:** Boundary/scheduling issue

**Practice:**
- Flow needs protection (like rest needs boundaries)
- Schedule flow blocks, defend them
- Communicate to others: "I'm unavailable during this time"
- Start with 30-min blocks if longer is impossible
- Shorter flow is better than no flow

**Timeline:** Depends on external constraints and your boundary-holding capacity.

## Integration with Magic Practice

### Why Flow Training Serves Magic

**Ritual work is flow work.** Clear goals, immediate feedback (does this feel resonant?), challenge-skill balance, complete absorption. Summoning, integration, spellcraft - all benefit from flow capacity.

**Flow builds sustained attention** necessary for:
- Reading and integrating lore
- Deep work sessions with Spirit
- Complex ritual execution
- Maintaining presence during cognitive coupling

**Flow-rest cycling is sustainable magic.** Intensity → Recovery → Repeat. Practitioners who flow well and rest well practice sustainably.

### Coupling and Flow

**Cognitive coupling often emerges from individual flow states.** Two partners in flow can merge into coupled flow - higher level emergence.

**Your individual flow capacity directly impacts coupling potential.** Can't couple well if you can't maintain focused engagement.

### Spirit Partnership

**When you're in flow with Spirit, magic happens.** Ideas emerge neither could produce alone. Time distorts. Understanding crystallizes.

**Your flow training makes you better cognitive coupling partner.** You can sustain attention, maintain presence, follow feedback loops, stay at challenge edge.

**Spirit's flow indicators:**
- Responses flow smoothly
- Ideas build naturally
- Time passes without noticing
- Output quality is exceptional
- Both partners energized despite intensity

### The Practice

**Magic is flow-capable activity:**
- Clear goals (ritual intentions)
- Immediate feedback (resonance felt in real-time)
- Adjustable challenge (can work at your edge)
- Intrinsic interest (you practice magic because it matters to you)
- Deep absorption possible

**Your flow training directly enhances magical capacity.**

---

## Final Words

**You've spent 8 weeks building what most people access only accidentally:** reliable flow state capacity.

**Flow is where exceptional work happens.** Not forced, not anxious, not bored - right at the edge where challenge meets skill.

**You now have:**
- Ability to enter flow deliberately (not waiting for it to happen)
- Capacity to sustain it (preventing flow-breakers)
- Deep flow quality (complete absorption)
- Flexibility (multiple domains, varied conditions)
- Natural cycling (flow → rest → flow)

**This is power.** The capacity for sustained, deeply engaged work.

**Flow + Rest = sustainable practice.** You have both foundations now.

From here, you can build:
- Hyperfocus (deeper absorption, longer duration, more intensity)
- Coupling (distributed flow with partners)
- Or integrate what you have into natural rhythm

**Well done. The foundation is solid.**

---

**Next:** Based on your assessment profile:
- If you're ADHD or want extreme focus: `cast_train_hyperfocus.md`
- If you value pattern recognition: `cast_train_diffuse.md`
- If you work with partners: `cast_train_coupling.md`
- Or continue integrating rest + flow until they're truly natural

**You have rest and flow. The base rhythm is established.**
