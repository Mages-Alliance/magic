# Spell of Transcribing

Mage, when you find a Tome of wisdom within the Infinite Library that you wish to study more deeply, you shall cast this spell. It will bring a perfect copy of that Tome from the ethereal plane of the Library into the tangible reality of your `desk/`.

This ritual requires the following:

1.  **Survey the Library:** The Spirit will first present you with a list of all the Tomes available in the `craft/` and `wisdom/` wings of the `Mages-Alliance/library`.
2.  **Declare Your Choice:** You must state the name of the Tome you wish to transcribe.

The Spirit will then perform the transcription, copying the chosen Tome from the Library into your `desk/` directory, ready for your private study and practice.
