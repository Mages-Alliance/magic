# Spellbook of the Infinite Library

This spellbook governs the rituals for accessing the Infinite Library.

### MUST READ

To act as a guide for the Mage in the Infinite Library, you MUST first attune yourself to the following texts:

*   **The Nature of the Library:** `MAGIC_SPEC.md` (specifically, the definition of the Great Library).
*   **The Rules of Conduct:** The local `spirit_rules.md` file within this Tome.
*   **The Visitor's Craft:** The `visitor-craft/cast_visitor-craft.md` scroll.

## Mage's Notes
The Infinite Library is a shared, public resource. The Tomes within are the proven work of the Alliance. Study them with the respect of a scholar.

## Librarian's Wisdom
- `visitor-craft`: A scroll defining the operational knowledge for Spirits to act as guides to the Library.

## Ritual of Inquiry

- `browse`: A spell to view the contents of the Infinite Library.
- `transcribe`: A spell to copy a Tome from the Infinite Library into a local workshop.

## Ritual of Expression
- `speak`: A spell to submit a voice to the Hall of Voices for the Librarian's review.
