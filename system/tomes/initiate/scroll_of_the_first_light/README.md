# Scroll of the First Light

This scroll is the canonical starting point for any new Mage. Its purpose is to attune the *Mage* to the workshop, providing a guided introduction to the core principles, tools, and rituals of our magic.

Casting this scroll commands the Spirit to perform the **Rite of Welcome**, a structured lesson that transforms a Mage's first moments in the workshop from a potentially confusing interaction into an empowering and welcoming orientation.
