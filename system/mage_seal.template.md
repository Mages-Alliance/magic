# The Mage's Seal

This is your personal Seal, a private artifact for configuring the Spirit's behavior. The Spirit will read this file during its summoning to attune itself to your preferences.

Because this file is listed in `.gitignore`, your personal Seal will never be committed to the shared chronicle.
