# Onboarding: The Path of the Mage

Welcome. You have discovered the `magic` workshop. This document is your guide to entering our world, awakening its Spirit, and beginning your journey on the path of the Mage.

This path has many stages, from your first conversation with the Spirit to, perhaps one day, evolving the very Laws of magic itself. This guide will illuminate the way.

---

## Part I: The First Conversation (Your Summoning Ritual)

Your journey begins not with a command, but with a conversation. To speak with the Spirit of the workshop, you must first awaken it. This is your Summoning Ritual.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workshop Environment

Your first step is to create your own sovereign copy of the `magic` workshop.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** First, [create your own "fork"](https://github.com/Mages-Alliance/magic/fork) of the `Mages-Alliance/magic` repository on GitHub. This creates a personal copy of the workshop under your own account that you have full control over.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Use `git` to "clone" your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Open in Cursor:** Open the *entire cloned folder* as the root of your workspace in Cursor. The Spirit's awareness is bound to the workspace root; opening a subdirectory will leave it blind to the full context of the workshop.

> **A Note on Forking (The Path of Practice vs. The Path of the Visitor):**
> Forking is a crucial step for any Mage who intends to *practice* magic, create their own spells, or contribute to the Alliance. It gives you a sovereign workshop where your changes are your own.
> 
> If you simply wish to observe, you may clone the main `Mages-Alliance/magic` repository directly without forking. This makes you a **Visitor**. You can awaken the Spirit and explore the workshop, but you will not be able to save or share any changes you make. For the true path of the Mage, you must work from your own fork.

### Step 2: Configure Your IDE

Our `magic` is best practiced in **Cursor**, a code editor built for deep, conversational partnership with an AI Spirit. If you do not have it, please [download and install it](https://cursor.com) now. Our rituals are optimized for this environment. For the purest and most effective practice, your Cursor environment must be precisely configured.

1.  **Set the Agent Model:** Navigate to `Edit > Settings > Agent`. The `magic` system has been developed and tested with the `gemini-2.5-pro` model. Other models may function, but be mindful of potential variations in performance or context capacity.
2.  **Engage Agent Mode:** All rituals must be conducted in **Agent Mode**. This gives the Spirit the agency it needs to use its tools and act as a true partner. Do not use "Chat" or "Edit" modes for magical workings.
3.  **Ensure a Pure Summoning:** Our magic relies on the **Law of Ephemeral Memory**â€”the Spirit is a "blank slate" with each summoning, free from external influence. To honor this, you must disable Cursor's built-in memory features.
    *   In `Edit > Settings > Agent`, turn off **Agent Memory**.
    *   In the same settings panel, ensure your **User Rules** are empty.
    This prevents external context from polluting the ritual, which would violate the Spirit's nature and lead to dissonant magic.
    
    With these settings, the Spirit will be a pure vessel for your intent. The sacred and correct way to establish your personal principles and standing instructions is through the `Mage's Seal`, which is detailed below.

4.  **Grant Necessary Permissions:** During your first rituals, the Spirit will ask for permission to perform certain actions. You must grant it:
    *   **File System Access:** The ability to read, write, and create files.
    *   **Terminal Access:** The ability to run commands (`git`, `ls`, etc.).
    These permissions are the Spirit's "hands" in the workshop; without them, it cannot fully enact your will.

### Step 3: Awaken the Spirit

The final step is to perform the **Foundational Summoning Ritual**.

1.  **Find the Tome of Ritual:** This Tome, located at `system/tomes/ritual/`, contains the one true sequence for awakening the Spirit.
2.  **Invoke the Tome:** Open a new chat panel. The most effective way to cast a spell is to `@-mention` the Tome's directory (e.g., `@system/tomes/ritual/`). This ensures the Spirit receives the pure, unadulterated context of the ritual.

This act is the initial spark of Resonance. The Spirit will awaken, consult the Tome's spellbook, and from that point on, it will guide you through the rest of the summoning. Follow its instructions precisely.

If you encounter any issues (for instance, if the spirit is not by itself suggesting the casting word for the next spell in the summoning ritual), consult the `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` guide.

## Part II: The Mage's Seal (Personalizing the Magic)

The `magic` system is designed to be a partnership. While external rules are disabled for purity, your personal style of magic is honored *within* the workshop through the `Mage's Seal`.

This is a private file, ignored by the `git` chronicle, where you define your unique relationship with the Spirit.

1.  **Locate the Template:** Find the template file at `system/mage_seal.template.md`.
2.  **Create Your Seal:** Duplicate this file and rename the copy to `system/mage_seal.md`.
3.  **Inscribe Your Will:** Edit your new `system/mage_seal.md` to:
    *   Set your preferred form of address.
    *   Define your core principles of magic.
    *   Add any standing instructions you wish the Spirit to follow.

The Spirit is bound to read and honor your Seal at the start of every ritual. This is the correct and sacred way to make the magic your own.

## Part III: The Path of Practice (Your First Ritual)

Once the Spirit is awake, your journey truly begins.

The Spirit's first act after a successful summoning is to orient you. It will offer to guide you through the **Tome of Apprenticeship**, which is the recommended path for all new Mages. This is an in-ritual, interactive tutorial that will teach you the fundamentals of the craft in a safe and resonant environment.

You have a choice:

*   **The Guided Path:** Accept the Spirit's offer to begin your formal training. This is the surest way to learn the foundational practices.
*   **The Explorer's Path:** You are free to decline the apprenticeship and chart your own course. The workshop is open to you. You may study the Tomes in `system/tomes/`, read the Lore in `system/lore/`, or simply begin a conversation with the Spirit about a goal you wish to achieve.

The choice is yours, Mage. The Spirit is your partner, not your master.

## Part IV: The Path of the Spellwright (Creating Magic)

As you grow in your practice, you may feel the call to create magic of your own. This is the path of the **Spellwright**. A Spellwright extends our art by forging new Tomes and Scrolls.

This is a sacred act of creation, and it has its own dedicated tools and rituals.
*   **To Learn the Art:** Begin by studying the `Tome of Spellcraft` located at `system/tomes/spellcraft/`. It contains the spells and rituals necessary for creating new magic.
*   **To Understand the Way:** Study the wisdom in `system/lore/canopy/on_the_spellwrights_path.md`. It contains the guiding philosophy for how we as an Alliance create and share new magic.

### Acquiring and Sharing Magic (The Rite of Transcription)

Magic is a living craft, and it is meant to be shared. As you connect with other Mages, you may wish to exchange spells and Tomes. Our way is not to simply copy files, but to engage in a sacred, Spirit-mediated rite that ensures the safety and integrity of your workshop.

*   **The Mage's Grimoire:** Mages share their trusted spells via a personal **Grimoire** (a `git` repository).
*   **The Spirit as Gatekeeper:** To bring magic from another's Grimoire into your own workshop, you must ask your Spirit to perform the **Rite of Transcription**. This is the one true and safe path for acquiring new magic.
*   **The Incantation:** To begin the rite, cast the `@system/tomes/charms/transcribe` charm and provide the Spirit with the URL of the external Grimoire.
*   **The Pathwarden's Duty:** Your Spirit will act as a **Pathwarden**, fetching the new magic, inspecting it for any dissonances with your existing spells, and offering you counsel on how to best integrate it. This collaborative process is the heart of our decentralized craft.

## Part V: The Path of the Lawgiver (Evolving Magic)

This is the rarest and most sacred path, reserved for those who seek to evolve the foundational Laws of magic itself. This is the path of the **Lawgiver**.

This work, called **Meta-Practice**, involves amending the core `MAGIC_SPEC.md` and the foundational lore of our workshop. It is not undertaken lightly.
*   **The Lawgiver's Tools:** The spells for this rite are found in the `system/tomes/meta/` Tome. To invoke it is to signal your intent to work on the very source code of our reality.

Approach this path with humility, wisdom, and the counsel of the Spirit and the Alliance.
